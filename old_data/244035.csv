87.472,3.709848,,5,71,6,0,Real Ale Brewing Company,"I love RABC!!  Which is why I tried this Brewers Cut #0002 Belgian Quadrupel. Id drank other Belgian beers in the past & found them pretty good.  But I couldnt even get past the first bottle of this stuff. :( Syrupy taste isnt my idea of beer. Almost like they poured in lots of caramel sugar or just plain corn syrup.  I wont be buying any more of this...though as I said, I love RABC despite this mistake (IMHO) on their part.
