Aroma is mostly chocolate with a toasty char, a bit of residual sweetness.

Damn this is a smooth silky porter.. Big chocolate with a bit of roast, medium bodied with low carbonation. Finishes suuuper mellow and creamy, slightly dry and a hint of lingering roast but it doesnt bomb out your palate.

Deep red orange with a slight head. Smells of light citrus hops and a bit of grass. Citrus in the hop profile, grapefruit rind and a light malt backbone adds a nice sweetness. It has a nice brightness with a fairly dry bitter finish. Although Iceland has a lot of European overtones their beer seems to err on the side of the USA. 5.9% is on the lower end for an IPA, but it definitely doesnt drink like a straight up pale.
