The aroma is chewy with woodsy malt sherry and vanilla molasses. Wonderful. The flavor brings plenty of the same ideas. The initial taste brings heavy prune and tobacco malt, cherries and walnuts. Theres a woodsy peat and root beer character to it and a slight alcohol touch that provides decent warming as this full bodied, heavy feeling barleywine slides down your gullet. Carbonation is subtle but cuts through to provide a tingle in the tongue. Excellent stuff and perfect for a holiday sipper.  ",95.847,Durge,Connecticut,10%,Thomas Hooker Old Marley Barleywine
