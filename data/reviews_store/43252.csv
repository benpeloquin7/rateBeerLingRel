POW!  This ninja ipa bred with Alis right jab laid me out like Joe Frazier!  the taste reminds me of squeezing the hops of their juices pulled fresh outta the keg.  These hops are earthy (like a hippie un-doused in patchouli stench), tangy, and super grapefruit and lemon rind-y.  Although, the aromas are quite flowery and have an almost dainty caress (entirely misleading).  I may not be high, but definitely hop-high after this monster.  the finish is all forest floor, but i cant stop drinking it.  This is one powerful brew.  Definitely overt.  Its like SN threw on a Dogfish mask and robbed the hop bank.  But then again, extreme brews are a nice idea, too bad these I2pas, I3pas, etc. are just becoming the hoppy version of everclear.  I have an idea - lets dump as many hops as we can think of and just add enough malt to placate those who may enjoy an almost-tasty beer.

aromas of strong dark cacao and semi-sweet baking chocolate, followed by an underlying layer of robusto coffee smores fresh from a campfire.  perhaps this isnt the best aroma for an IS, but it certainly brings back memories of childhood.  this pitch black brew appears to have a rich, creamy taste based on the ""midnight lace...and creamy espresso..."" head.  the aromas also yield a pleasant toastiness and strong toffee and molasses undertone.  on the palate, this chewy chocolate-ey stout  shows the versatility of a solid stout.  roasted malts reveal the deep character, with layers of dark chocolate, brown sugar, black coffee (perhaps with a hint of tia maria shot in there), and just a note of alcohol.  sams stout is almost a great replica of youngs double chocolate with increased noticed alcohol on the palate.  its a defnitely a tasty brew, and one that will definitely remind you that theres no better time for a stout than in the tail of winter.  congrats, sam adams (and the BBC), you have made a quality product.  this is a first, aside from the extreme series.

The aroma is barely present, showing muted white peaches and coriander.  The taste is rather accurate for the befitting name.  im just not sure which came first.  Its more of a fruit beer than it is a weisse.  furthermore, unlike any other dfh, wheres the hops?  i was kinda hoping for a hoppy wheater.  all in all, its rather 1D, and perhaps i should retaste it at another time.
