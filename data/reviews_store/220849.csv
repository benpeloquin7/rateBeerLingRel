Love the bottle, somewhere between a bomber and a regular 12 oz. The smell of this beer is very noticeable, unlike some beers that do not smell like their underlying fruit. This one IS strawberries. Taste was good, but a strong sourness lingered. Not like drinking a lambic. Overall a good fruit beer. ",45.019,djn4,England,5.1%,Samuel Smiths Organic  Strawberry Fruit Beer
