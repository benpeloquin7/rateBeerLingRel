This is a very interesting beer, and a great one to recommend to craft newbies who are not used to actually tasting anything other than bland carbonation in their fizzy yellow water (but without blowing their taste buds away in one fell swoop like you would if you fed them a Rochefort 10 or Bernardus 12).

Poured into a trappist goblet and it formed a nice head which remained for a few minutes. Outstanding color - a beautiful burgundy with just enough hazy yeast to say, ""yeah, Im a decent beer, youre gonna enjoy this"". Aroma is very pleasing, just enough sweetness and malt to entice a taste.

The taste is great for the first moment, a well-balanced combination of malt and fruit, but it doesnt develop much further and dissipates fairly quickly. This fact, combined with the 6.5% ABV makes this a good choice for a small session beer.

Overall this is a really fine beer that I have enjoyed many times with food or without. I always try to have some on-hand because its just perfect as a go-to brew no matter what my mood. ",93.46,brikelly,New York,6.5%,Ommegang Rare Vos
