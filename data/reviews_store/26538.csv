This is the third in a series of beers made under the JeanChris label (Jean from Jean Chocolatier and Chris from Mi-Orge). Chris was directly involved in selecting the barrels of lambic at Cantillon that were used in this gueuze blend. As with other Cantillon gueuze blends, Nomad includes 1yr, 2yr and 3yr old lambic but the proportions used are different in Nomad. I was told that the typical Cantillon gueuze blend is about 17% of 3 year old lambic but in the Nomad they used 33% of 3 year old lambic. 

The beer poured a vibrant gold color with a touch of cloudiness and a slight white head that disappeared after a few moments as expected. 

The aroma of Nomad is musty/earthy, a bit funky with a slight hint of some woody notes and citrus. All the fingerprints of a fantastic Cantillon gueuze. 

The taste is very pleasing.  A nice lemon bite on the tongue but not as acidic as a classic Cantilon gueuze, there is more of a rounded edge to Nomad but yet a more complex taste I believe, some woody notes which I dont typically get in a Cantillon gueuze. I think this comes from the fact that 33% of Nomad is made up of 3 year old lambic as opposed to a classic gueuze which is around 15-20% of 3 year old lambic. I think the higher % of old lambic lends a more balanced taste.

Overall I think Nomad is a very well balanced and well thought out gueuze.  Refreshing with a nice dry finish but it still approachable, especially for those that cant always handle a very acidic gueuze which this is not. Nomad is definitely worth seeking out.
