The aroma is rich with intense pine and resiny hop character, with a hint of sweet malt. The beer is a rich orange copper color, and pours cloudy, with tiny hop flakes occasionally lifted by the carbonation. The flavor profile is intensely hoppy, with a wealth of pine hop flavor and bitterness to match, lasting into the finish. There is some light caramel malt present but the balance is definitely to the hops. The mouthfeel is modest, without much creaminess but abundant carbonation is present. The finish is slightly bitter but not astringent. All in all, it tastes like a very fresh and good american pale ale homebrew.

The pint sized cans are a novelty, but the batch i purposed were befouled with a black mildew that easily wiped off. Unsure if this is related to Hurricane Ike or not.  ",87.133,Biohazard,Texas,6.3%,Southern Star Pine Belt Pale Ale

Flavor was a nice balance of chocolate, with some oak and vanilla noticeable. The vanilla continues into the finish and lingers with a slight hint of astringency from the roasted malts. Hops are present, but not overassertive. Mouthfeel is modest, considering this is a stout. Leaves a bit of a roast vanilla coating on the mouth and tounge.
