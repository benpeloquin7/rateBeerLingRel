This is no Guinness! I went and toured the beautiful Dublin Guinness Storehouse this summer and drank their watered down, beer for the ignorant tasteless McDonald myopic masses. Yuck! Green Flash Double STOUT is the absolute opposite! If you want a big beer 9%, with great aroma, huge taste, smooth feel and clear complexity ... then look no further. I would rather buy one Green Flash Double STOUT than a 12 Guinness draft in the Dublin Guinness Storehouse. By the way, I travel a lot and NO WHERE in world, Prague, Berlin, Brussels, etc. can compete with US Craft Brews! We are changing the world from bland Light and Dark Lagers to incredible tasting ales, all because of the advancement of brewing technologies, and clean yeast strains. For those in the know regarding craft brews the US is famous, and I am not very patriotic or hold to our US foreign policies.
Bottom line: You have not tasted a good stout until you have tasted Green Flash Double STOUT!
Cant wait to drink it after a day of skiing.
Enjoy!
