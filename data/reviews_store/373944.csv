One dimensional. 
Appearance: Pleasant copper color. 
Taste: Disappointing. No structure; lacking complexity. Flavors of fermented brown sugar diluted with dishwater. 
Palate: Thin and watery.
Strange how this beer is brewed by Malt House brewery and sold by five different ""brewpubs"". Given the poor quality of beer, this appears to be more of a marketing gimmick than a product crafted with pride. ",,brewking,Canada,5%,Creekside Cat Tail Red Ale
