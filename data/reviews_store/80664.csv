This beer has a very soft floral aroma with an even balance of grains, is light golden in color, and has a fair head for a lager.  It is lighter than their Pale Ale, as it should be for a Summer seasonal, but still has a decent body.  The overall palate is dry with floral, citrus undertones to compliment the malt grainy majority that creates a very crisp beer. ",39.339,smerrell,California,5%,Sierra Nevada Summerfest
