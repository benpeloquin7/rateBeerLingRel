Appearance is cloudy.  This is probably due to the yeast and the wheat.  You can see chunks of the yeast floating around in it, probably because it is WAY over carbonated.  Flavor starts off like a Corona; skunky.  Picks up some citrusy flavors and finishes moderately well with some maltiness, probably from the two row barley.  On the palate it is far too carbonated.  Im not sure diet soda has this much carbonation.  Maybe I just picked up a bad six pack of this stuff but its not my favorite.  Its far too carbonated so you miss so much of the maltiness that should be there from the 2 row barley.  Its light struck (skunky), so you miss the herbs that should be in there as well.  Maybe this really is ale yeast as it says on the bottle, but it really doesnt taste like many of the ale yeasts I have tried. ",35.73,soren2007,California,4.8%,Lost Coast Great White

Light hop aroma.  Slightly more cloudy than expected.  Flavor is what i think is crystal malt and a light fuggle finish.  It is smooth and creamy compared to the majority of American brew, just not smooth enough.  This ale is almost a good english bitter.  Its aroma is too weak.  Its not clear enough.  The hop flavor is a bit weak.  But its still very good for this side of the pond. ",56.592,soren2007,Arizona,4.5%,Four Peaks 8th Street Ale

Its very close to the traditional ale bitterness and complexity that you find in small village breweries, but not quite.  The usual creaminess and mouthful seems to be missing.
