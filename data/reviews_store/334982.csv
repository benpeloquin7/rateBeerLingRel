I do not regret buying it. I was expecting the typical dry cider (also known as ""real"" or ""farmhouse"" cider). The cider was very carbonated, which didnt hurt the taste at all, I just lost about 1/5 of the cider in an explosion. The taste does not hide the yeast at all. I think it would pair awesome with cheese due to the yeastiness in the taste. All around an ok cider. This is (I believe) their first commercial batch and Im sure it will only get better.
