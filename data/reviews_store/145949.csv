Overall: For this being at 10.5%, it is incredibly drinkable to the point that it should be illegal. Smooth body, balanced between bitter and sweet that aches for constant gulps. This is a prime example of what a great Imperial Stout should be. Highly recommended. ",99.841,shroud0fdoom,Michigan,10.5%,Founders Imperial Stout

Overall: If I could get this year round, this would be in the fridge at all times. This showcases what Centennial hops are about. One of my favorite single hopped IPAs around. Recommended.

Feel: Medium light body, velvet carbonation. Overall: There is something special about this beer. Aroma-huge flavor-huge bitterness huge. I didnt get a chance to review this last year (spur of the moment drink). Still is as good, though I remember the aroma last years was more ripe than this years.?
