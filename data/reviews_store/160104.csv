Sort-of a cold vanilla smoke-and-flowers smell.  The aroma is fantastic.  

Taste is ""sublime"", though very strong alcohol.  Id like it better with a little less alcohol flavor.  Fans of barley wine will likely be happy.  I dont much care for the aftertaste.  Would be fantastic paired with a strong cheese, maybe blu cheese on a pizza?! ",99.577,Jodaboda,California,8.7%,Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Black IPA
