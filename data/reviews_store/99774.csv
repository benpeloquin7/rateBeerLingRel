Nice dark pour with a dark tan head.  Aroma up front was straight bourbon.  After it warmed a bit you get the roasted aromas as well.  The taste has that chocolatey bitterness and roasty flavor, but it still has that sweetness and warmth from the bourbon.

It tastes malty sweet up front with more slight hints of raisin, you get a tiny bit of alchohol up the nose at this time, but all this passes and turns into a deep roasted dark chocolate bitterness at the back of the tongue.  I heard the brewer describe this beer as their Scotch Porter, and I couldnt describe it any better myself.

Bitterness fades away and leaves you with a nice floral taste that lingers till your next sip.  I feel that this is a well balanced IPA, not too much or too little of any one thing.  Very drinkable.
