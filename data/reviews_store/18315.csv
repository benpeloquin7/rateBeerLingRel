The appearance is really nice too, as is most of the southern tier brews- a nice amber with good lacing- not so much thick but good retention.  The thing I like the best about this IPA is while it is not my favorite, it really accomplishes its brewers goal- to make an accessible yet authentic IPA.  Filtered and clean finish  wouldnt normally turn me on to an IPA, but this, like SNPA, is something I could show my macro-friends and convert them to hoppiness.
