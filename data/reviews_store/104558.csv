Pours a deep amber, almost brown, with a thin strip of beige lacing. 
Smells sweet but not much else on the nose. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Taste is wondrous: the beer makes its money here. Sweet and malty with strong molasses and dark fruit taste at the beginning with a surprising cocoa finish.  ",90.182,stimulus,California,6.5%,Port Brewing Hot Rocks Lager

A: Pours a cloudy, nearly opaque copper with a one finger white head.
S: A citrus mixture.
T: Wow, what a nice blend of flavors for this wit: the orange in the forefront with the coriander and something else falling into the background.
M: Pretty light body with great carbonation.
D: Its too bad that I had to split this one, but we agreed that another bottle would have been quite pleasurable to digest.

A: Dark brown with ruby red around the edges.
S: Strong vanilla, creme brulee aroma.
T: Wow, the vanilla, caramel, and milk flavors dominate this brew and completely mask any semblance of alcohol.
M/D: Medium bodied considering the milky feel. Not as thick as syrup, and the carbonation makes it feel light. ",97.865,stimulus,New York,9.6%,Southern Tier Blackwater Series: Creme Brulee Stout
