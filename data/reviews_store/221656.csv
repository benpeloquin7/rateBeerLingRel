More recently, I frequented both The Ram in Hammersmith and The One Tun in Goodge Street.
While the beer is fine in both establishments, in the former theres an unfortunate tendency for No Special and often No (Youngs) Bitter either.

The One Tun still manages to sell the range, but something Ive noticed since the Wells merger is that while the beer is more consistent, its nowhere near as good. ",39.417,nickhsw19,England,4.5%,Youngs Special (Cask)

I joined this site to specifcally warn people of this noxious brew whose taste is a combination of earwax and grapefruit

The pint I bought was in The Cross Keys, Covent Garden last night - I managed two mouthfuls before feeling uncontrollably sick which only a bad pint of Directors managed 30 years ago. ",82.699,nickhsw19,England,5%,Brodies Old Street Pale Ale
