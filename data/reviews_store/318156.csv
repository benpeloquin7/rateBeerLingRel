Little to no head leading to obviously thin lacing. Malt predominant on nose with spicy hop character in the background. Nice weight and texture on palate with sweet malt supporting the 8.2 ABV. Not as hoppy as I would expect from a west coast IPA but a Sid offering from a brewery with a great track record.  ,97.702,Pfortson,California,8.2%,Lagunitas Maximus
