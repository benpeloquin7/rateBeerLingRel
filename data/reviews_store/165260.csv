Day one there was a large presence of a bitterness like under ripened banana peel. This taste explains why I have had a few reviewers mentioned a chemical like presence. At least I presume this is what they were also picking up on. 

This beers high ABV has thinned the body and added a wonderful warming effect to the beer. Main characters included the already mentioned bitterness, lemon and a heavy amount of clove and coriander. 

But due either the role of oxygen in the bottle or the addition of the yeast this beer improved greatly. The aforementioned bitterness was minimal and no longer distracting me from the lemon, vanilla and bannana notes. The beer moved from a heavily sweet and spiced beer with a unique but slightly unpleasant bitterness to a wonderful balance of spices, fresh citrus and banana. 

If this is due to yeast I wish they would add more to the bottle or filter less out. I am pretty sure it is the yeast apposed to oxidation as my second tasting was identical to the first and the third was so much better. 

If you enjoyed this beer I would suggest you try La Buteuse by Le Trou du Diable. It matches a wonderful balance between sweetness and fruit, much like king heffy but with a bitter finish. Unlike this beer the first glass is as good as the last!
