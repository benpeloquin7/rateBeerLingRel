It reminded me very much of Dogfishs Raison Detre. When I tried it beer for the first time I found myself savoring it so much that it went from ice cold out of the liquor store cooler to room temperature in my hand. Where that can be a killer with some beers this one took on a whole new interesting flavor, resembling the drinking of a really nice liquor neat. If one does not normally like the intense bitterness that IPAs offer, this is definitely worth a try. Not your common IPA by any means, but definitely now one of my favorites.
