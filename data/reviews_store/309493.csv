tasted, 
this is made with minimal intervention completely natural,

A true expression of an apple/pear cold, crunchy & refreshing,

My advice is to serve in a small wine glass or Champagne flute with no ice,

The ice will make it seem too watery so keep it well chilled in the freezer ",43.265,Craftmecca,France,7%,Bordelet Sydre (Sidre) Brut
