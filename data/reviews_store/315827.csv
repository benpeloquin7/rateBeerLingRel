Its flaws are amplified due to this. The flavor of cherry is faint at best, with a mild tartness to accompany it. The aroma is a slice of three-week-old cherry pie that you forgot in the back of the fridge after Thanksgiving: spicy, with an underlying odor of fermenting cherries. The head is thin, and fleeting. The color is a clear, dark orange. If you stare long enough, you might be able to convince yourself that there is some red in there. Overall, this might be an okay beer if Belgian Red didnt exist, but we cant ignore the fact that such a high bar has been set for a cherry beer in Wisconsin. Its palatable, but not much more.
