I remember more hop bitterness behind porter elements.  Whether that is true or not many traditional porter elements are present here withouth the excessive sweetness growing in craft porters.  Aromas of nutty chocolate give way to raisin and soy flavor.  BTW love the raisins and soy sauce porter deScription. ,98.993,Stangl,Ohio,5.8%,Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter

Pours a very hazy golden with white fluffy head.  Opens with an interesting candy sugar/cascade bitterness.  Body is very clean with some light spice and fruit notes.  This is pretty tasty out of the bottle which recommends aging.  Probably a good idea to mellow the sweetness and biting hop flavor.   ",95.963,Stangl,Pennsylvania,7.9%,East End The Ugly American
