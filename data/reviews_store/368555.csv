After pouring it into my snifter, it had a strong smell of bourbon, vanilla, and barley wine. It was amber in color. After one sip I feel in love with it, it has a great bourbon vanilla after taste. One of the best barely wines I have had. The longer I let it sit out and get to room temperature the more the flavors matured, the warmer it got the more you could taste the toffee and nutty flavors. Great beer that I would definitely recommend.  ",97.811,meghan1201,Michigan,11.5%,Bells Planet Series: Saturn - The Bringer Of Old Age

It poured like a beer; it was amber in color and had a slight head. It smelled like root beer and vanilla. The taste was very disappointing, I was expecting it to have a strong root beer taste and it did not. It tasted more like a beer than root beer; it has a hint of vanilla in it as well as wintergreen and was not sweet at all. It was an odd taste and was not what I was expecting.

After pouring it, it has a strong smell of root beer and smells very sweet. It is dark in color and pours like a beer and has a slight head to it. It taste just like root beer and is very sweet. It is hard to believe that there is alcohol in here you can barely taste it. It is very good and very easy to drink. It makes a great root beer float with bourbon ice cream in it!
