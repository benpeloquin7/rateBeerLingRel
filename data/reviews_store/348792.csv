The alcohol heat is almost hidden with the caramel malts and hop profile. I truly believe the secret to this beer is in the uinta yeast strain. Maybe the micronutrients also set the hops off. And as I said thats balanced with the malts. Liquid copper gold. Decent head. My favorite. ,95.847,clint404,Utah,7.3%,Uinta Hop Nosh IPA
