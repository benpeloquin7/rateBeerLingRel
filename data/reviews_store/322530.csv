I would much rather have straight up Everett any day of the week. Massive mocha bubbles. Carbonation is way to sharp lending a weird dryness to the palate. The oak character is overpowering. I love BA stouts and porters but this is probably one of the worst Ive had. Reminded me of some central waters shit.  ,99.312,Charliemanson,Vermont,,Hill Farmstead Everett - Bourbon Barrel Aged (2014-)
