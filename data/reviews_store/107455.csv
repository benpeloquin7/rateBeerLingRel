Poured into 8oz snifter. Dark brown to black in color. Coffee and chocolate really come out in the aroma. Chocolate overpowers the coffee at a chilled temperature while the coffee pops through as it warms up. Super smooth for 9.2%. Very reminiscent, if not better than, Speedway Stout I had earlier that day.  ",,thebitterendaz,Colorado,9.2%,Odell Ground Control

An American wild ale that could pass for true Belgian gueuze - it has the Belgian Barnyard nose usually lacking in most American sours. Nice refreshing sour flavor that lingers well.
