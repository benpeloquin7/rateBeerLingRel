It came in a 750 ml champagne bottle with a red wax top and a wine looking simple label. It was labeled a sour cherry Belgian blonde. My brother suggested I join this site as he is somewhat of an introvert and he mentioned the exchanges on this site, with ratings and all, were quite entertaining. He is an engineer and somewhat of a wallflower so I was hesitant. He immediately directed me to this brew and instructed me to review the ratings. I must admit it was entertaining to say the least. Phillycraft hit the nail on the head, this cherry slut is taking a beating. A beating behind the school yard by a bunch of nerds shellacking a cute cheerleader transferred from a private school for ruining the curve in AP calculus. This brew as huge in cherry aroma and big in cherry flavor. The theme from the aristocracy, it is artificial. I have enjoyed cherry NyQuil, cherry vodka, and Almanac brewery, Jolly Pumpkin and many others. Artificial is not a bad deScriptor as my girlfriend has artificial mammary glands, and I think they are wonderful, and a Miss June states that many others do too. So for the beer the so called artificial character, no wired medicinal character, mostly cherry sourness and some tartness. It was somewhat reminiscent of a cherry sweet tart that reminded me of childhood. I do believe that rates that gave this non deScript term were more offended that it was scoring better than some of their clique brews. For example Reynolds314 even had a neat 5 point business plan that he thought there was some money making hedge fund conspiracy. Some seem to be overly preoccupied with ""fake"" or ""influenced"" ratings than to give deScriptors of the brew. Just rate it! I thought it had some vinegar notes but not too out to f balance for style, and the crisp tartness really shined through. For Reynolds and you unsuspecting beer geeks, I feel slightly sorry for you. Not that you were duped but you have spent so much time rating beer, 2900 plus ratings, equivalent of approximately 10.2 days of your life. Those of you should have spent more time learning how to navigate web sites. Let me enlighten you. This sight has a tab called highest raters. Click on it and you may get a better synopsis of the rating you are hoping for. On the other hand, folks like me, new to site, would rather see what a newbie might like. I know Pliny is good. I want to see who took the time early on to rate something they enjoyed, not a bunch of dork lemmings explaining to me how they loved stone fruit and mango in their Pliney. I found this brew did have the deScriptor of manure, aromatic indols. I like it in lambics and other brews as long as it is not distracting. This brew did not have that distraction. A friend of mine loves Simcoe XXIPAs due to the typical cat piss character. She loves loves it, however I do not. This brew was earthy manure and barnyard, great. I really had to enjoy Adnielsen telling folks to fornicate with themselves. He does not seem to understand that sites like this earn revenue by getting traffic. Berating and chastising raters discourages the folks from revisiting. If only you, 10,000 plus raters, who wasted 35 days of your life, were the only credible sources, then this site would not exist, and you may have nothing to bitch about. Adnielsen, spend some time away from RB and spend some time learning English, so you can have a more extensive vocabulary. Then, you can come back and give some real constructive criticism. I do believe that the owners of this site love this brewery as it brings them traffic. As for manufactures pushing their product, why not? This brings more traffic and more raters. With the addition of raters we all get a better standard deviation. For those of you who that rate for 35 plus days, it is a measure used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. Back to beer, it does have a lean tart lactic sourness, with some wheat character complemented by the aforementioned barnyard aromatic indols. It has a light mouthfeel and body with nice prickling champagne like carbonation. Some oak is evident and the cherries dominate. For those ""Hate Homers"" ""Shill Slashers"" and ""Troll Trackers"", which I am none of, my rating will not count. The Bayesian statistic scale they use here works well, so do not fret. Side note: bantering about beer on sites like this and Yelp is like having sex without an orgasm. With that in mind, I will go have a few more Up a Krieks and appreciate the natural and artificial traits of greatness of both my girlfriend and the brew.
