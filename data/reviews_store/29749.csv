A mostly diminishing average frothy off-white head tops up a clear light orange body. Moderate lacing. No particles. Many small bubbles. Aroma presents malt being light biscuity while hops are heavy citrusy and resiny... Yeast character is moderate sweat. Also, there are excessive notes of band-aid and .herds in a strange way that was surely not meant to be. (at least, i hope!!) This tends to indicate that the bottle aged badly but we could detect signs of infection. Initial flavor is medium bitter while development develops band-aid surrounded earthiness. Still have those herbal evocations. Finish is short Light to medium body... oily texture... Lively carbonation... ",98.136,Siroy,Virginia,8%,Legend Imperial IPA
