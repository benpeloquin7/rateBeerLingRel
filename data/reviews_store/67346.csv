My experience was very different, with no character apart from the overwhelming and nasty alcohol content.  I love dogfish heads 60 and 90 min IPA, and their liquors besides, but this was just strong for the sake of being strong.  1 dimensional and worthless.  Maybe I got a bad bottle, but it was terrible.   ",99.841,badman,Delaware,18%,Dogfish Head World Wide Stout 2001/2003-Present (18%)

Its a barleywine to be sure, and strong.  I dont wish to comment much on the flavor and behavior, the above are averages.  Ive been drinking this since 2001 vintage, and every year it changes, as well as changing (duh) with age, (though less than with vintage).  The 02 was probably the best year, though 01 and 04 were quite solid too.  ",93.068,badman,New York,10.8%,Brooklyn Monster Ale

Spicy and alcoholic, with a bitter finish thats almost overwhelming.  I very much enjoy this brew, though there are more refined, and outright better IPAs available.  Could use a little more flavor developement, and the mouthfeel is a little on the thin/spicy side for my taste.  

Despite its shortcomings, which are minor nitpicks and vary by vintage, its an excellent beer, and another feather in the cap of those clever fellows at victory brewing.

Improves much when sampled at the brewery, bottling takes a lot of the complexity out. ",98.082,badman,Pennsylvania,6.7%,Victory HopDevil

YES!  An excellent example of the style, rich and strong, without letting the alcohol overwhelm the full coffee and chocolate notes.  When I have to pick a favorite beer, this is typically the first one that springs to mind.   Ive been drinking it for years, and each vintage is relatively consistent, and delicious.

A solid strong ale, but a little unrefined.  The fruit notes are underdeveloped, where youd hope to have a little identifiable character rather than just an impression of fruitiness.  An enjoyable brew, but not exceptional.  

Ive had this a few times.  I drink it more often than this review would indicate though, so perhaps theres magic in that bastard. ",99.683,badman,California,11.2%,Double Bastard Ale
