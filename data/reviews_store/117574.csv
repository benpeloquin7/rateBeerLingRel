So pale a gold hue, it looks like cider. Loose white head which falls away rapidly; perhaps due to barmanship not brewing however. Aroma of Honey-O cereal, taste more of the same. Hopping balances the sweetness, but doesnt intrude. As the temperature rises and the beer opens up, husky grains overpower the honey. Thin but not overly watery mouthfeel and medium dry finish make this a perfect summer slammer (42C in the shade today!) A brilliant alternative to CUB or LN lagers.
