BUT the weird nit that balanced but sorta balanced nature of this beer makes it very enjoyable. I liked it a lot I think mainly because of it&apos;s malt characteristics. There is nit a whole lot but the flavor here is built upon the malt sweetness so for me that sweetness does bleed through which makes all of the very many hoppy fruity flavors of this beer enjoyable. Pick it up if you are it and give it a try. Hop heads delight but one of the very few hoppy beers I enjoyed.

The head was dark dark tan not to big maybe a one finger. The aroma is coffee espresso a little chocolate it smells a lot like a very well made imperial stout. The taste is a lot like the smell just a punch in the face espresso coffee a bit bitter in the center of the tongue but it&apos;s a good bitter no carbonation. Very think body this is a sip beer for sure. You get the alcohol taste a little in the back of the throat. Overall a very very nice Imperial Stout. The best part is it&apos;s not to hard to track down.

I love the brewery, I love Chocolate Stouts but this was a major disappointment. It was so fake tasting it was hard to finish.
 
Great bottle Sam Smith has awesome labels always.

The smell was a hint of what is in store as far as taste just fake off brand chocolate syrup.

It pours syrupy brown almost. As in looks not consistency.

Didn&apos;t get much of a head

The beer heated up very fast actually almost instantly started to adjust to room temp.

Okay the taste...it taste exactly like this really cheap crappy chocolate syrup my mom bought for me when I was a kid and I used it in milk just to make her feel better about it but when she wasn&apos;t around I poured it down the drain. That&apos;s almost what I wanted to do with this beer near the end of the glass. No offense to anyone who likes this but it really is a Stout with chocolate flavor added. Not a Chocolate Stout. I wouldn&apos;t say it was even a Stout it had no bite no bitterness nothing like a Stout should have. I would say stay clear of this beer.
