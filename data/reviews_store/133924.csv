The Pour was dark brown with barely a hint of highlighting at all. The head was thin and quickly dissipated with very soft lacing. Aromas of roasted malt and a certain woodiness above and almost coffee-like presence. It drank smooth and fully, but not overly, carbonated. Its flavor was at once woody and sweet with a grassy bitterness backed by a strong chocolate malt with a subtle spice to it, finishing tannic and mildly bitter.  

Overall a very interesting brew but Im just not sold on it yet, maybe with some aging and rounding out of flavors itll improve.  Also, I expect this beer to be refermented and saw no evidence of yeast in the bottle. ",97.096,LonelyStranger,California,10.2%,Sierra Nevada / Dogfish Head Life & Limb

Aromas were of roasted chocolate malts and coffee with a light flora background. Mouth feel was oily but not heavy and lightly carbonated. The flavor was forward with chocolate, roasted malt, and caramel. I felt it had a vanilla and liquorice-like undertone to it and was reminiscent of plum.
