Being a Florida resident I go there often, it was the day I first drank Tiger.If I wasnt so stoned right now I might remember the other beer I ventured but that doesnt matter; it should be obvious that I enjoyed your brew a little more.I purchased a 6-pack pon this fine eve and as I plucked it from my grocers cooler I thought,""hmm....this seems a lil flimsy."" I was, naturally, speaking of course of the package that the beer was contained in.Being a beer drinker with a range of consistent standards the beer was the last thing we selected at the store.There was a 5 minute wait at the register and a 4 minute drive home.I got out of the vehicle and the slight moisture build up caused the cardboard packaging to tear and all of my sweet beer came crashing to the ground.Maybe your engineers foresaw this prediciment and the bottles were made from a glass that did not break from a 3 foot fall.I understand marketing and cost cutting, BUT, if you spend a small amount extra on making a superior box design then your sales would improve. Im sure you know that its the package that helps sell.When picking up beer the genuine beer man knows that if you cut back on something cheap like the box,well that says alot about your company.Please listen to what I say I know what Im talking about here I am after all ""THE CUSTOMER.""
