Noticed a more complex taste than the last few blondes I had. Had to rate it a 3 for appearance because the only time I saw it was when my girlfriend knocked it over on the table. Overall I really liked it. Plus, Im a sucker for a well-named beer. Id order it again.  ",94.222,cdface,Belgium,8.5%,Delirium Tremens
