A refreshing summer beer. Definitely makes up for its price but not the best beer for sure. Lacks a strong aroma, a clear golden look, minimal head. A sweet refreshing taste. A light body and thin texture with soft carbonation and an easy ending. An enjoyable beer in hot summer days, not the best quality though. ",11.472,atuney,Germany,4.7%,Oettinger Hell
