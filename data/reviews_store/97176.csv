The appearance was cloudy with a honey-like color, small head that seemed to dissipate quickly.  The taste bitter sweet - one can surely taste the sweet malts and the bitter hops both separately and in tandem.  The palate was amazing.  Seemingly, this beer has four different and distinct tastes depending on where this beer resided.  Hoppy, malty, bitter, full, soft carbonation - very refreshing to have such a complex palate.  Sweet on the tip to hoppy in the back of my mouth.  Overall, this beer would be a full twenty out of twenty, but the aroma could use some help.  Maybe with a slightly more lively carbonation it would help with carrying the aroma.  So many hops probably doesnt help with head retention with the hop oils present and carbonation might help with that as well.  But, just my opinion.

The appearance is golden, clear, and pours with a nice white foam. This beer comes with a medium bitterness and light sweetness.  Refreshing for a pilsner.  This beer also comes with a medium body, slick feel, average carbonation and is slightly bitter.  Overall, I found this beer to be refreshing as a pilsner.  I am not one to thoroughly enjoy a pilsner, but this one I would buy again.  I believe it to be the body more so than anything else.  Everything else was good for a pilsner but the body was slightly heavier than a normal pilsner. ",6.883,jhudson1977,Wisconsin,5.5%,Minhas 1845 Pils
