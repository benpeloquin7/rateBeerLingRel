I wasnt expecting this at all.  It has an out-of-this-world hop aroma almost akin to a Pale Ale.  I love it.  It is creamy and has a wonderful body, not too light or crisp as some Lagers get.  Its pale in color, like a bright straw yellow with white head.  Super easy drinking but very flavorful at the same time.  Might be my new favorite.

The higher alcohol is not apparent at all.  It has a great cloudy color that reminds me of an unfiltered wheat beer.  Has a nice head like beer too.  Then the taste is a softly sweet apple with that creamy vanilla undertone that sets it apart from any other cider Ive had.  I tried this one cold but Ive heard it is great warmed up with a cinnamon stick and some orange zest.  Yum. ",97.041,NEBWineNBeer,Michigan,6.9%,J.K.s Cuve Winterruption Farmhouse Hard Cider
