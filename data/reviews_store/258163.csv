The flavor is that of a delicious chocolate with dried plum. The head is tan and frothy. The palate is silky smooth with very little carbonation.

It doesnt taste particularly strong any which way and is just sort of a muddled mess of odd stale flavors and the tiny hint of fruit that you taste at the very end. It becomes much better mixed with their Golden Ale and you can actually taste the passion fruit more strongly. ,21.956,Orestes211,Hawaii,5.4%,Kona Wailua Wheat

The appearance is nice a burnished orange with a decent head. It doesnt taste amazing but is a nice summer beer for an evening after work or just out on the porch. The palate is light and slick with little carbonation and bitter finish. ,59.192,Orestes211,Oregon,5%,Deschutes Twilight Ale

Smells of carmel with just the slightest hint of fruity sweetness and grass. The taste is masterfully balanced with a delectable bittering hop finish that is well muddled with a deliciously dark caramel malt flavor. It strikes a great balance between being watery and overly thick resting at a silky smooth texture as it washes your palate. Perfect for anytime in my opinion! ,99.206,Orestes211,California,7.2%,Arrogant Bastard Ale

There is a slight tinge of sour that just underlies the fruit notes of apricot and fig before mellowing out to the toasted nut finish. There is not much on the nose being a doppelbock and the appearance is also normal for style. A dark unfiltered beer with a slight hint of red at the edges. The palate is perfect, combining the crisp carbonation with a nice light mouth feel reminiscent of a porter to me. Overall one of my favorite beers.

The palate was completely lacking for me. There was very little carbonation despite the head holding for a while and the mouth feel was just like water. There is a slight flavor of mango at the beginning but that gets completely lost in the blind bitterness later. The bitter flavor is piney and resiny. The beer does look great in a glass being a nice shade of light amber with a slight haze and the head created a fine lace and gave over lots of aroma. ,92.331,Orestes211,Oregon,6.7%,Ninkasi Total Domination IPA

It is a very lovely dark amber in color with a nice off white head that sticks for a moment. The taste has some of the apple that is in the smell but also has the flavor of grapefruit on the finish. The palate isnt entirely pleasing being somewhat oily but the beer is more than flavorful enough to overlook that. ",97.702,Orestes211,California,8.2%,Lagunitas Maximus

Its a rather lovely clear yellow for a pilsner being neither too bright nor too pale. The mouth feel is great with plenty of carbonation that lasts throughout the pint. However the hops only present through the nose and then only slightly. There is that hint of floral dryness but the body of this beer is lacking. While nice for an afternoon in a hot beer garden it is nothing spectacular. ,46.535,Orestes211,Colorado,5.3%,Oskar Blues Mamas Little Yella Pils
