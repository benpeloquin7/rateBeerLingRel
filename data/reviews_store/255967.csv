This is a world class IPA if ever there was one.  I bought  a pint for my friend and one for myself.  When I was half way through my second pint I threatened to drink the rest of his if he allowed it to  get unnaturally warm.  It must be respected as an unearthly brew of excellence.

It was actually the beer that turned me on to beer and kicked off a fairly debacular summer.
