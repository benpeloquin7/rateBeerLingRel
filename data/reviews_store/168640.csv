Classic ""Simoce"" nose (polarizing to some). Gold to light orange color with some haze and medium-low head retention. Flavor mirrors the aroma with medium-high hop bitterness, medium-high grapefruit, citrus, mango, with a hint of resiny hops. Low malt flavor, which is AOK by me for a West Coast style IPA. Overall, one of my new favorite IPAs; all of the flavors marry quite well in this beer. Impressed with how the hop flavor and aroma survived in a bomber!
