It seems to me to be a Hefeweizen and a Pale ale married into one beer.

Its got a banana and citrus flavor in a very refreshing light colored and slightly hazy well carbonated package. But then it wacks you on the head with a nice bitter hop finish and a lingering taste of grapefruit and peaches. The citrus and hops mask the high alchohol content pretty well. This beer has a real ""summer"" feel to it and is far more refreshing and crisp than a typical IPA.

Its an India-Hefe-Pale-Weizen! ",96.705,jorossian,Pennsylvania,8.5%,Victory Hop Wallop

A healthy combination of fruity/floral aroma accented with a vanilla/piney backdrop. Just the right amount of hops which for me - a bit on the heavy side but not overdoing it to spoil the complexity. Very rich and satisfying to the pallet.  Yum.

Ive been pleased to find this is regularly stocked at Wegmans. Makes me want to go grocery shopping right now. ",93.908,jorossian,New York,7.3%,Southern Tier IPA

That said - I love this IPA. Not too overbearing yet still gives a far more satisfying hop fix than a standard PA. This IPA is so light and crisp it will sneak up and bite yoou if youre not careful.

Seeing as how my corner grocer now carries this puppy in its ""specialty beer"" section for 6.99 a 6 pack I think Ive found my new weekend remedy.  Check this beer out if youre an APA fan whos ready for a slightly bolder flavor experience but not ready to go overboard. ",80.015,jorossian,New York,6.9%,Brooklyn East India Pale Ale
