It was probably already defective, because this bavarage is without any preservatives, additives and non-pasteurized so it must always be at the temperature betwen 1-6 degrees Celsius and you must drink it in 30 days...so I am almost 100 % it was not properly stored. I drank it and believe me it was not as near as so bad you are writing about.  ",3.087,pivokov,Slovenia,4.3%,Kovako Pivo Penina Izabela Svetlo
