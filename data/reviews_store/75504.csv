Appearance: opaque dark brown

Smell: peanut butter, dark chocolate. Almost no bourbon.

Taste: heres the bourbon. Lashings of it. Peanut butter is almost absent. Mid-palate woody bitterness. A gentle brown sugar presents in the after-taste. There are complexities in the flavour that keep on coming.. quite fascinating.

Taste: revelatory. Chocolate, fruit, caramel, gentle coffee. This is a porter rather than a stout - the chocolate is up front and centre, the coffee is in the background, but still there.

Mouthfeel: for such a thick beer the mouthfeel is lovely - dense and creamy rather than viscous.

Aftertaste: rich caramel fruit, chocolate, light coffee.

As it warms: the coffee becomes more apparent in the nose, but the flavour leans to more chocolate and fruits.

Taste: dark coffee bitterness, some alcohol, subtle dark fruitiness.


Mouthfeel: silky, but enlivened by lively carbonation. It almost dances on the tongue which is very unusual - and pleasing! - for a RIS.


Aftertaste: lingering hop bitterness with distinct coffee overtones.


As it warms: the bitterness subsides, leaving a rich roast coffee flavour with subtly sweet notes.

Style: Foreign/Export stout, 8.5% ABV

Appearance: very dark brown, ruby highlights. Fluffy light brown head that dissipates rapidly.

Smell: as is common with F/E stouts, mainly a delicate hint of coffee. Some slight sweetness.

Taste: delicate and light on the tongue, with a coffee flavour - think more a breakfast blend from a boutique roaster. Alcohol is well hidden. 

Mouthfeel: well carbonated, strangely thin but not in a bad way. The mouthfeel makes this beer *dangerously* drinkable - without any alcohol burn you could almost think this was a regular stout and drink it in that manner!

As it warms: molasses flavour emerges from the ruby depths of the glass.


This is a dangerously drinkable beer, all the more so because its a quaffable big stout. The added bonus? This is an amazing beer IN A CAN. At about $12 for a 4 pack, you have a fantastic, world-class beer that you can take to cookouts, the beach, concerts, and state parks.
