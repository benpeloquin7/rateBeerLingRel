After unwrapping the opaque wrapper, I revealed a New Belgium goblet.  Satisfied that the glass would suffice, I left the rest of the box for later.  A couple untwists of wire and a cork pop later, my glass was full.  I held the glass up to my computer screen to see the typical belgium style cloudy golden appearence.  A brief wiff revealed those typical belgian banana-y yeasty aromas, and I was ready to dive in.  A good solid gulp revealed those typical belgium flavors, maybe a little more banana-y than I'm used to.  Much like anos196....i mean andrew196...I was surprised that I didn't taste the 11% that the bottle claimed.
