Pours a beautiful deep amber with some pulp, large white head. Aroma of grapefruit and stone fruit, Id prefer a little more aroma. Spicy and caramel hop flavour is balanced well with malty drive. Great pale ale session beer. Hopefully they stay true to their promise and release seasonal batches.  ",26.207,Goldie,Australia,4.7%,Sample Brew Batch No.1 Pale Ale
