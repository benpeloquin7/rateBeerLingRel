But in saying that a great effort from the boys @Little Creatures. Strong use of cascade left a nice but small explosion of passionfruit & grapefruit & a nice long after taste of caramel & toffee flavours. On tap @The Mary Ellen Hotel, Merewether, cant do it justice by rating it after a day @the races drinking mass produced soap water that is Tooheys Extra Dry. Will rate it on tap this week sometime.
