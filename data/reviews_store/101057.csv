I love Trappists and this one beats them all (never tried the Wes...velten sp?).

The dry fruity aroma sucks you in then you take a taste. It starts sweet and lightly fruity and just the tiniest hint of licorice, then warms with a bit of sherry and 9.5 abv up on its way down. Finally, after a few seconds, you get the very mild hop bitterness to perfectly counter all the maltiness.

Mouthfeel is exactly what you expect from a Belgian Trappist. Bubbly and long. ",99.365,belgianale1,Belgium,9.5%,Achel Extra Bruin (de 3 Wijzen)
