Strong, sweet aroma of dates, raisins, and alcohol. Flavor is intense, syrupy sweet -- Id have to say cloying. Exploding flavors of assorted sugars; primarily dates, port, and brown sugar. Almost tastes of fruitcake. Hot alcohol finish -- cant hide that 16.42%. Most definitely not a session beer, not even two. A sipper, but certainly an interesting experiment in pushing the limits of brewing. Id recommend Samaels over this.   ",96.817,AlaskaBrew,Colorado,18%,Avery The Beast Grand Cru Ale
