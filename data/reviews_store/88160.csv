Aroma is malty and sweet with pine, go figure. Some fruity, sugary notes as well. Appearance is dark brown, hazy with a short, quickly disappearing head. Flavor is...strange. Definitely an ale flavor with malt and hops, but also piney and sweet. Certainly lives up to the deScription. Not a bad beer, but not one Id reach for again. Finish is piney with lingering hops and slightly alcoholic. I would like to try this without the pine infusion as I think it would be a decent ale. Otherwise, its interesting but not my cup o beer.

WHOA to the alcohol flavor! At 19%, im not surprised! Taste is very sweet and alcoholic but not as sweet as I""m used to with the mead around here, which is nice. After the initial sweetness, it becomes dry and finishes spicy with herbal overtones throughout. SO many flavors! Mouthfeel is lightly syrupy with a pleasant burn in the end.With all the alcohol (and $30 a bottle) its a sipper, not a swigger.
