Particularly after a hot day involving exercise.
Fantastically creamy, redolent of boddingtons but strong and sweet with enough hoppiness to keep you gulping. Stays sweet to the bottom of the glass. Not a complex beer, peach and hops and cream. Excellent ale for kicking off an early, ""unplanned"" evening session. ",79.258,Wundoo,Scotland,5.1%,Williams Brothers Seven Giraffes (Cask)

I thought this was a superbly balanced ale - perfect for an afternoon session.
Floral, fruity (lemon, pineapple, mango, pineapple, apple) and bitter but with just enough sweetness (honey) to make you want another half dozen.
Excellent example of an English golden ale. ",44.159,Wundoo,England,4%,AllGates Brigantia
