Fairly subdued fruity aroma with some caramel and resiny tones. Tastes roughly bitter, earthy and resinous with some fruit (pineapple, mango, passionfruit) and a hint of caramel. Certainly less fruity than the HBC, but still fairly fruity. Aftertaste is long and bitter, but smooth; not overpowering, but you certainly notice it. Fruit notes are soon lost, but the earthy resin flavours are retained, along with the bitterness. Moderately strong carbonation.  ",92.602,bobbo_,Scotland,6.7%,BrewDog IPA Is Dead - Galaxy

Minor lacing. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, generally citrus with hints of caramel, also slightly earthy hints of almost pine or resin. Tastes boisterously bitter with powerful citrus flavour; oranges, passion-fruit and lots of hops. Slightly sour, but with sweet fruit notes and again a hint of caramel. Fairly soft, but noticeable carbonation. Aftertaste is fruity with pineapple, mango, much less of the orange; tastes similar to Punk IPA with more fruit. Fairly dry with a long bitter, slightly oily, aftertaste.

Powerfully bitter, very fruity with strong citrus flavours, incredible citrus aroma. Would drink again. ",96.251,bobbo_,Scotland,6.7%,BrewDog IPA Is Dead - HBC
