Pours dark roasted brown and expertly compliments with a light frothy tan-colored head. The taste is extremely complex and will please the most intellecutal of connoisseurs. First to hit ones palate is a facade of slight hoppiness that succumbs to the honest robust roasted  malt that embodies this stout. It then elegantly concludes with a faint aftertaste of smoky chocolate and berries. This is a must try! ,99.841,Arnoldgenes,California,9%,North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout
