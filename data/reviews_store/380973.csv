Pours a nice burnt orange color with an off-white head. Great coffee and hop aromas upfront. Floral hoppy bite of IPA supported by slight bitter coffee bite underneath makes for an interesting combination. Very well balanced and surprisingly complimentary flavors. Definitely a different IPA, but delicious nonetheless. ",83.679,Devo1968,Oregon,6.9%,Rogue Cold Brew IPA
