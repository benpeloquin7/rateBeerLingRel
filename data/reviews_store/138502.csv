Strong coffee and Chocolate flavors and aromas. I enjoy tasting new brews but have keep coming back to this 1 of a kind Stout. No light shining through very little carbonation. Perfectly blended well balanced alcohol well hidden. Lots of coffee lots of chocolate! Amazing!  Now I have to ship some to my bother in Florida who cant find it.  ,99.947,Vinnytheworm,Michigan,8.3%,Founders Breakfast Stout
