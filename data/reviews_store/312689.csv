Fortune is Millers attempt to compete with Sam Adams. Well, in this battle, Sam Adams is the clear winner. Miller Fortune isnt horrible, though. Its lightly carbonated, seems to quickly taste flat. Malty tase, with a nutty aftertase. While I dont hate it, the chances of me buying this again are extremely low. ",7.462,MetalRob72,Wisconsin,6.9%,Miller Fortune
