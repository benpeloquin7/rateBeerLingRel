Not my favorite. Apparently they tried to mate a wheat beer and an IPA in order to get a beer you can drink all year long... I drink IPAs all year long, I do not care for wheat beers--and apparently I do not like my IPAs diluted with wheat beer. The color is gold and clear, light on the tongue and in alcohol. The aroma is a little bit of bread and a little bit of citrus. Not very hoppy, takes more of the wheat flavor profile.  ",78.487,alandis01,Colorado,5%,Denver Beer Sun Drenched

I dont taste many of the things that some people on here have included in their reviews, those sound disgusting. This was quite enjoyable and I would buy it again.
