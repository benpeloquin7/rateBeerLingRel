Bold words- I know! lol this brew is fantastic and perfectly comfortable in its cozy nook of classic simplicity. Pours a hazy orange with decent head; lacing is on point. On the nose, floral resin is really all you get. Depending on who you ask, its really all you need! One can detect a mild yet very much consistent floral/hop aroma followed by crisp notes of delicate flower/pine notes and juicy citrus throughout. Has just enough malt structure to support its better half. Clean finish with just enough punch and linger to leave one begging for more. 
Folks, this is truly a special beer in that shes very sessionable. In theory, one could enjoy Yellow Rose on a daily. But then you loose that special, special-ness about her. She is a treat in my book and I treat that with respect. ;)
Cheers!!
