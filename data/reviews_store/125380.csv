S: Touch of vanilla and sweet but not cloying malts. Hops are present but arent massive and invading. Just a touch of bitterness.

M: Full bodied and quite large. Clean coating across the palate with solid carbonation. The finish is long and stunning. As the beer warms the finish goes from bitter and creamy malt to sweet vanilla whiskey.

The malts arent nearly sweet enough, the weight of the beer is lacking, there is almost zero finish. I get just about nothing off the nose which should ring of sweet caramel, toffee, and sugar.

D: A great attempt at a new style of Barley wine. Being how the next release wont be till 2013 hopefully they work out the kinks and produce something outstanding. Maybe this beer just needs some time to age. Time will tell.

A: Burnt Amber to Sienna with haziness brown hue. Unfiltered with a very nice thick head. Solid lacing but fades moderately fast.

S: Really complex off the bat. Hints of sweetness and sugar mixed with high california piney hops. I would have liked more sweetness off the nose being a barley but this is Stone so understandable that hops are the key ingredient. Thick malt back up the hops.

T: Minor sweetness up front but clean. I would have liked more sweetness, not cloying, but just a touch more being a barley. Mid palate is clean and the beer finishes dry. The hops arent a torpedo on this one, instead they creep into your senses from the back of your palate. Very hoppy but not a hop bomb; this one is a sneeker.

M: This is a very heavy beer. They used a lot of malt to really back up the hop profile so it weighs heavy on the palate. Almost a meal in fact. Entire palate is coated cleanly and the hops on the finish completely take over the palate with a bittering affect.

D: Overall I think its a pretty good barley wine. I would have liked a lot more sweetness up front and perhaps even more hop aroma as well as bittering in the beer. It seemed pretty mellow for Stone. I know they didnt dry hop this years batch (2011) but maybe they should have. ",98.78,noturdadsbeer,California,11.26%,Stone Old Guardian (Vintages 2004 and later)

Poured into an 8oz snifter.

A: Deep gold with amber hues but more on the bright side of amber then the dark. Solid head retention that fades into a spiderweb like lacing on the glass.

S: Massive piney hops is the first aroma to hit your senses. Its as if you too a wiff of the biggest pine tree in existence and let the flavor wash over you. Touches of citrus grapefruit also take shape behind the chronic and pine notes.

T: Massive pine to match the nose. Comes across somewhat sticky and resinous but the bitter is truly there. Citrus fruit such as mango and pineapple are present but pine and chronic flavors are dominate. The malt is solid and doesnt subdue the hops but instead balances them very well.

M: Because of the prefect malt backbone this beer weighs heavy on the palate. Top of mouth is coated but the bitterness creeps from the back of the palate to the front. Citrus notes linger on the middle of the tongue and the finish just doesnt stop. Almost no booziness present.

D: Having the opportunity to taste this beer is up there with getting Superbowl tickets. Its worth the time, effort, and money. Its exceptional in all standings for what an Imperial IPA should be. Its not over hopped nor is it over malted, its perfectly balanced- just like all the beers RR does. I only wish it were made more often or in higher quantities because 8ozs is just not enough.

A: Head is a dark brown that recedes quickly with great lacing. The beer itself is deep, dark, black. Zero light passes through - fits the name if you ask me.

S: Rich, burnted, roasted malts. This goes beyond coffee into triple shots of espresso. There is a hints of sweetness - toffee- but its truly espresso to the next level in terms of a bitter malted beer.

T: Amazing! Instantly your palate is hit with intense rich espresso and coffee flavors with just a touch of sweetness to mellow it out. This is a sipper. The malts are rich and complex and it nearly forces you to sip and enjoyed. The finish is strong and lingers. There is a touch of booziness on the finish but thats expected at 15.9% Outstanding!

M: Full bodied and rich. Coats your mouth and tongue very well. Carbination is on the light side allowing for the rich thick malts to linger.

D: Amazing beer and kudos to Avery. This beer is massive and intense and made for imperial stout fans and bitter beer loves everywhere. Potential to age 5 years or more are there. In fact id pick up a case of this and taste one each year for 6 years out just to see where it takes you. Avery is quickly becoming known as the aging brewery since their beers (this one as a prime example) are massive and intense and need time aging to bring all the flavors into fruition. Outstanding beer, pick up a case! ",99.577,noturdadsbeer,Colorado,15.4%,Avery Mephistopheles Stout

A: Thick billowy off white/tan head. Head receded after a few minutes but stayed fluffly like a cloud (think belgium golden here) right on top of beer. The beer its self is a very dark brown - chocolate - to borderline black. Very thick, almost no light gets through

S: At first sip the beer comes across with a hint of metallicness to it. But with most porters Ive found this to be the case. There are notes of sweet peaches, like the peach candy worms, but follow through to coffee tones and bitter chocolate. Not a lot of peach action going on, very surprising here, instead much roasted malt backbone.

T: First sip reveals the roasted malt backbone first picked up on the nose. Bitter chocolate follows through. There is zero peach going on. If anything there is a touch of sour, just minor on the finish. Once again: NO PEACH. The finish is pretty weak to be honest, probably because of the touch of sour. The flavors do not linger and falls flat making the need/want for a second sip undesirable. Almost zero booziness on the finish which was nice since its 9.5% abv.

M: This beer is medium bodied yet still decently thick; surprising for a porter. Granted it is an Imperial Porter I didnt expect the thickness of the malts as much as they were.

D: Overall its a great attempt at a beer. This is an Imperial Porter and if you were to blind taste this beer it would come across as such, to a degree. The peaches being almost non apparent for a beer being made using peaches in the fermintation as well as in the barrel aging is very disappointing. This is an average beer overall, too thick for even an imperial porter, and false advertising with the use of peaches if you ask me. Great attempt - pour follow through.

A: Perfect brown with a nice latte colored head that starts high but fades in time. Fantastic lacing and tight bubbles.

S: Caramel and toffee up front but not too sweet. Plums and dark fruit follow and intices the senses. You can pickup bannana notes from the yeast as well.

T: Caramel up front and toffee to finish. Now the finish is very very long and the flavor is a bit fleeting. Makes you want to keep sipping honestly. Warm and slightly booze on the back of the throat. Great hints of dark plum and cherries for fruit and the caramelized malts for the sweetness. Has a nice bite too.

M: This is a full bodied beer for sure! The carbination is perfect as is the balance of this beer between heavy and sweet. The finish lingers but the fruit dies fast forcing you to keep sipping, i love it.

D: This is an amazing beer and one that should be put on a pedastal for Belgium beers. This is a sipper and one that should be shared amongst friends over a fire in leather chairs smoking a stoggie.

A: Pours black into the snifter with a chocolate brown head that quickly falls. Lacing is low and fades fast, just like the head.

S: Cherries! The beer smells like a blast of carmalized malts and twizzlers. Amazing how much the cherries from the aging comes off. The malts are sweet and carmalized from the sugar added and its a very inviting beer. The aroma is heavy and lasting and man is it a great nose.

T: Its quite a rich stout with cherry sweetness and carmal up front on the palate. The finish is very long and doesnt fall flacid. Deep coffee tons lightened by the cherries makes this a pleasure to drink. Its not nearly as large as Mephistopheles with roasted/burnt malt but its still present.

M: Has low carbination and isnt very heavy. I like this. Its a very rich and powerful stout but you dont feel the weight of the malts which is pleasent. The alcohol is very well masked and doesnt come across boozy. Its very balanced yet still way powerful. Cant wait to see how this thing ages.

D: I wish they brewed this beer yearly. Its outstanding. I think should be aged for a least a year but probably 3 to 4 before being cracked again. Its a beer for a cold night or celebration. I wish they sold more than 6 bottles per person because I would have got 5 cases. ",99.736,noturdadsbeer,Colorado,15.43%,Avery Barrel-Aged Series  6 - Margarete
