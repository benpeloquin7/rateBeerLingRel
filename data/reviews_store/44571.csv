A rustic orange pour with 1 finger head, white and foamy. Lacing is thin, to be expected. 
Sweet and sour aroma. Apples, caramel, floral, mint?, candied sugar, some citrus. 

Flavor is quite nice. The apples and citrus provide a bit of sweetness and sharpness. Caramel runs throughout, but not up front. Tart. Funky. Hints of herbals and earthiness with a bit of an orange glow finish. Really nice. ",93.134,Mebuzzard,Colorado,6%,Crooked Stave Good Glory Sucker Punch

Heres the stout.

Black and glassy. Nothing else. Chocolate milkshake looking head. I kept pouring the beer in the middle of the frothy goodness and the stream didnt even make a dent, total absorption. Even head at first, as it settle it looked like the surface of the moon (er, at least pictures of it).

Rich aroma of coffee, mocha-chino, caramel, and chocolate. Mouthwatering really. Faint overripe banana and some black plum.

Starts off the flavors with coffee, it seems thin. The prune turns to plum and a bit biting. the coffee is dry and the caramel aroma has nothing to offer in the taste. The flavors could use more muscle and thickness. Tastes similar to the Lion Stout from Sri Lanka.

Still a darn fine beer. ",73.079,Mebuzzard,Scotland,4%,Orkney Dragonhead (Bottle)
