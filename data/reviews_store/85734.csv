Very watery beer, tastes alright, but kind of weak.  Good for one beer, but I would leave it at just one and try something else after Im finished.  Poured dark yellow with thin off white/white head.  Smooth, nonbothersome aftertaste and decent amount of carbonation.  Decent but you could do better. ",44.284,wassonc,England,6%,Ridgeway Bad Elf  (6%)
