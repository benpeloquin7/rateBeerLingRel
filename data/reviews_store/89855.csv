From the bottle, the beer poured without much head at all; I looked for even a little creamy head, but what there was was thin and quickly bubbled away.   Maybe its just me, but this had an inadequate body and thin feel for an oatmeal stout.  The coffee flavor had hints of burnt roast, with a not totally unpleasant smokiness.  Oatmeal stouts are among my favorites, but this didnt stack up. ",93.134,Dwillis63,Michigan,5.2%,New Holland The Poet
