Batch 2, aged at least 5-6 months...maybe a bit more. The pour yields a medium golden body that starts out mostly clear, but becomes increasingly cloudy with each careful pour. A thick head of off-white froth holds strong, fading very slowly. Dense swaths of fluffy lace coat nearly the entire glass. On the nose, the wine barrel influence is immediate and pervasive. Dry, vinous oak comes across peppery and spicy. Following is ample white grape must, elderflower, and secondary hints of tart berry fruit. After clearing the initial tart, oaky blanket, a base of wheat and dry cereal grain emerges, setting the stage for hints of orange peel and distant coriander. It smells quite dusty, showing signature Hill Farmstead house funk. Hops are floral as can be, suggesting of citrus blossoms and maybe a touch of lemongrass. With a fantastic aroma to live up to, the flavor does not disappoint. Again supremely oaky, showing peppery, mineralic tendencies backed by sharp white and link fruit, the wine takes center stage. Dried, dusty wheat and crushed dry flowers move in, followed by some citrus acidity and tart, funky farmhouse yeast. So many layers, I could go on for days. The palate is effervescent, lending a champagne-like tingle to the dry body. The acidity is bracing up front, giving way to a surprisingly lengthy hop finish. The elderflower character reminds me of somethign from Fantme or Cazeau, only more refined and complex than both. What can I say? Another masterpiece from Shaun Hill. This is almost becoming routine.

Notes of sweet orange peel, soft coriander, and perhaps a touch of ginger all come to mind.  It get a waft of milky whipped cream as well.  Flavors follow suit, nice and soft up front, with a foamy, creamy grain underbelly.  From there, the orange-lemony rind notes brighten things up, followed by hints of zippy coriander and white pepper.

Hops are abundant, lending ample grassy, piney aromatics. The flavor follows suit, sharp and dry, quite bitter with all the grass and straw notes. Distant tropical fruit adds a subtle fruity note. The sharp, dusty brett has beaten the malt into submission, yielding the driest possible remnants of bread crumb and cracker. The mouthfeel is perfect  bone dry, lightly prickly, and cleansing.

Deep, dark, black forest cherries lend a lush sweet-tart fruitiness.  Oak imparts a touch of ever-so-slightly toasty vanilla and slightly peppery, dry tannins.  Hops are potent, primarily green and grassy, with a touch of pine.  Flavors are again quite roasty in the malt base, showing rich, biting earthiness along with scorched molasses edges and hints of grilled fig.  Black cherries again add hint of acidic sharpness and dark fruity sweetness.  The barrel imparts more juicy, peppery wine character  dry, sharp, and earthy.  Hops show strongest on the finish, mainly grassy in nature.  The palate is substantial, yet it bravely defies the conventional notion that a 10% monster has to be cloying.  On the contrary, it is adequately dry and well attenuated, even slightly chalky in its somewhat yeasty finish.  Carbonation is just shy of moderate, but it manages to lend a sufficient drying effect.  On the whole, this is damn near tops in the genre.

Varied flares of lace range from tall and skinny to short and fat.  Nice looking brew.  The nose is unfortunately a bit plasticy, showing the sure-fire signs of early infection.  Its not all-encompassing, as I still pick up the main theme of toasted cereal, scorched bread, and lightly glazed puffed rice, but it is obtrusive.  IBUs are low, mainly lending earthen tones.  The black pepper comes through slightly.  I also get some metallic tones.  Flavors follow suit, based in dry, toasted bread with rice cereal grain tendencies.  Hops are mainly aged, dry, and peppery in nature.  I get some distant, leafy tobacco notes as well.  Its actually a damn nice BdG, I only wish the plastic tones werent present, as young and soft as they may be.  The palate is substantive, but more than sufficiently attenuated.  It comes across delightfully dry and prickly, with a slightly chewy midpoint that clears out lickety-split.

The nose is absolutely breathtaking, showing a delectably light, fresh, tart wheat base with beautiful juniper berry freshness, dusty, dried pineapple, and dusty lemon.  Brett C is absolutely signature here, and the dusty yeast marries the soft woodiness of the Old Tom gin wonderfully.  It smells crisp, tart, refreshing, complex, and...well...just fantastic.  Flavors expand upon the seemingly endless nose.  The tart, milky lactobacillus lends an entirely different yeast component, yet the dusty, pineappley brett C remains an integral component.  The juniper and the pale wheat dance with soft apricot and fruity lemon.  Its buggy and delicious.  The palate is crisp, with a soft yet lively effervescence the cleans the tongue off, reinvigorates it, then cleans it off again.  Simply outstanding.

Aromas are quite hoppy and roasty, showing notes of moderately toasted caramel and rye malt with a coffee-toffee kiss and biting, sharp, citrusy-piny hops.  Notes of resin and grapefruit rind show over the darker, lightly chocolaty malt.  Belgian yeast is dry and lightly buggy (perhaps in the very early stages of oncoming infection...before things get nasty).

The pour yields an ultra-cloudy, glowing, dusky golden-amber body thats strewn with limitless pinpoint carbonation.  A tall and moderately dense head of steadfast, cream tinted foam leaves patchy flares of lacing all over the glass.  The nose is exceptional, showing a soft and fresh base of creamy, pale cereal thats about as well attenuated as a 9% beer can be.  Hops are complex and perfectly married to the malt base, showing lemon pith, sweet rind, and tropical pineapple.  Buggy, brett-laden wood imparts notes of dust, white pepper, and creamy Chardonnay.  Hot damn, this smells just about perfect.  Flavors are right in line, running the gamut from creamy pale malt to assertive, lemony, citrus-driven hops and dusty, peppery, fruit and brett-kissed wood.  The ""lemon cream pie"" bottle deScriptor isnt far off, as the creaminess really moves to the forefront at points, but it ultimately finishes dry and dusty like a proper brett beer should.  Close your eyes and you get bold notes of creamy, oaky, Napa Chard. The palate is substantive, creamy (I feel like Im over using that word...but its quite applicable here), well carbonated, and drying on the finish.  Damn fine beer.

The nose is very wheat heavy, showing clean cereal grain notes that dominate the secondary lactic acidity.  Its a little muddled for a Berliner, not as crisp as the better examples of the style.

I was surprised to find that at 1.5 years, and despite what I deem to be proper cellaring, the cork on this puppy was half way saturated and almost too soft to pull.  Still, it came out clean.  The pour yields a very slightly hazy, glowing, golden-tangerine amber body.  Neverending streams of fine bubbles feed a fuller than usual (for Cantillon) head of lasting, eggshell tinted foam.  Short, rounded flares and spots of lace slowly meander back towards the body.As expected, the nose is drop dead gorgeous.  Nobody captures that musty-sharp apricot perfume note like Cantillon, and this one is no exception.  The Hallertau hops lend a perfectly restrained, grassy, hay-like bite.  Of course, theres the requisite buggy, woody farmhouse funk, but it too seems relatively soft thanks to fruity and cereal-like malts.  Its incredibly saison-like, and nods to a few exceptional American beers that Ive had lately, most notably Upright Fantasia....only better.  I guess the nod really goes the other way then, doesnt it?The flavor follows suit, tart and sharp, mouth-puckering at times, but also reasonably subdued thanks to the leftover malty sugars.  Concentrated apricot sour is the most prominent element, followed by hints of lemon and dried pineapple (a brettanomyces signature).  German hops again add just the right amount of grassy, leafy, bitter bite. Damn tasty.The palate is a little bit creamier and heftier than most gueuze, but still exceptionally dry, with crisp, prickly carbonation.  It is exceptionally drinkable.  Overall, Cuve Saint-Gilloise falls just a bit short of its masterful cousin, Cuve des Champions, but Im really splitting hairs here.Lately, in my mind, Hill Farmstead has been in hot pursuit of the title ""Worlds Best Brewery.""

Courtesy mgumby10.  Pours a hazy tangerine yellow color with a small, fizzy, bubbly white head.  Jagged columns of lacing protrude from the body like solar flares do from the sun.  First sniff.....WHOA!  This smells fantastic!  Strong notes of sour apricots and nectarines, two of my favorite fruits, explode into the nose.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit, mild farmhouse funk, and lightly sweet candy sugar complete the aroma.  The first sip stands behind the promise that the nose makes.....this thing tastes great.  Funky as hell, sour, tart apricots and nectarines dominate again.  Grapefruit is present again, playing more of a background role.  Mouth puckering, but not as extreme as some other Cantillons.  Balanced perfectly for my palate.  Moderate carbonation levels match the dry, medium body perfectly.  This is a mind-blowing beer.  Second only to Kaggen (amongst dozens of incredible beers) at the infamous Merritt Island Throwdown, March 2008.8/4/9/5/17 = 4.3.  Cantillon cuvee du van 89.  4 years old as of summer 2009.  Exclusive 375ml for Le Bier Circus in Brussels.  Im told this is the Cuve des Champions with a different dry hop billing.  Pours a hazy, medium golden-amber hue with fine streams of micro-bubbles that effervesce towards the surface, pooling into a thin but steadfast head of pure white foam that lasts for the duration.  Just a few spots of sticky lace remain behind.  The aroma is beautiful, steeped with sour apricot and peach notes amidst citric acidity and strong, woody oak notes.  The requisite horseblanket funk is there, though the residual lemony grassiness from the dry hopping cuts through it well. Flavors are equally delicious, strikingly sour with notes of lemon, apricot, peach, and nectarine. Though not the focus, the grassy hops lend just a bit of a resinous bite that really works. Mostly dry, tart, crisp and slightly puckering, with a nice and subtle hop finish.  Fantastic brew.  Cantillon rules! ",99.471,Beerlando,Belgium,5%,Cantillon Cuve Saint-Gilloise

The nose is decidedly peppery and floral, suggesting of hibiscus, grain of paradise, and both dry lemon pith and oily rind.  The underlying malt base shows honey-kissed, dry wheat bread and crisp pils.  Theres a softly acidic component, hinting perhaps at a slightly eggy and lactic yeast profile.  Flavors mirror the nose, not overly spicy, but sufficiently so and dry.  Its again quite dry and floral.  Honey is really an afterthought, as the bready malts and sharp, zippy farmhouse yeast dont succumb to its sweetness.  It gets spicier on the back end, touching on lemongrass.  The palate is less substantive than its 7% label foreshadows, showing crisp acidity and lively carbonation up front before transitioning to a creamy midpoint and then back to semi-dry.  Unique brew.  I think the role of the honey is to calm the intensity of the spicing.  It wouldnt hurt to back both off a bit, though.  Solid brew for sure.

It smells of the perfectly balanced and complex essence of expert barrel-aged saison craftsmanship.  Fresh-cut malted wheat is robust.  Softly buggy farmhouse yeast is dry and dusty.  Wisps of lightly peppery flower petals meet remnants of pungent grassy hops.  And then theres the barrel influence.  Oh that barrel makes everything even better.  Soft Pinot Noir tannins lend a fruity, aromatic bite, and lambic-esque lacto-citric acidity keeps things wild and dry.  Tart, buggy, woody, sharp...it simply smells amazing.The flavor is also exceptional.  Wheat plays such a prominent role...probably more so than in any other saison Ive ever had.  The cereal-esque base is so distinct, and it works beautifully with the slightly dank grassiness of the hops.  Nips of tart, tangy lemon and dried pineapple meet dusty wildflowers, wild farmhouse yeast, and funky, woody barrel bugs.  Acidity slices right through the ever-so-slightly creamy malts.  Damn tasty stuff.  Not as mind-blowing as the aroma, but great nonetheless.The palate?  Its dry, dusty, and zippy, with a moderate body and a crisp finish.

Honey is nearly fully attenuated, and was clearly used with (welcomed) restraint. The yeast is distinct, offering a soft pungency that I enjoy.Flavors largely follow the nose. Fresh, bready grains are kissed with the softest possible glaze of honey. I get a distinct hint of flaked oats, and maybe some hay. Zippy, dusty, peppery spice nods to marigold, dandelion, and other such dry, fragrant wildflowers. Hops are again grassy, providing the perfect amount of bitterness.  So tasty.The palate approaches perfection. The moderately substantive body has been attenuated to the point where I dont think an additional micron of alcohol could be squeezed out of this thing. Dry as a bone, this beaut is laced with intense, lively carbonation that intensifies the wildflower spiciness before cleaning the palate off entirely. Even after the swallow, I can still feel tiny bubbles tickling the roof of my mouth.If I close my eyes, thoughts of Saison Dupont rush in...only this is better. Yes, I realize that is a bold statement. Its spicier (without going overboard), drier, more flavorful, and perhaps most importantly, more ambitious without getting carried away. Excellent beer from arguably the best saison brewer in the country at the moment. ",99.524,Beerlando,Vermont,6.5%,Hill Farmstead Anna

Nearly pitch black, the dense body supports a thin, swirly, light brown film, leaving behind a soapy, glass-staining wash that slowly rejoins the body.  Based in lush, ber-rich, bittersweet dark chocolate, the velvety-smooth malts suggest of caramel and toasted brownie.  An overlying wash of smooth, wood-kissed bourbon, spicy vanilla bean, and mild smoke wrap everything up beautifully.  Flavors follow right in line.  Wave after wave of rich dark chocolate and lightly scorched caramel are quite sweet, touching also on dulce de leche, soft vanilla, fading green hops, and lush, lush bourbon.  Super smooth and expertly balanced.  The palate is nearly full, yet light enough to show some life.  Theres a (welcomed) lightly papery texture that keeps things from getting overly syrupy, yet the sugars do a good job of covering up the alcoholic heat.  Damn fine beer.

The pour yields a dark and dense, inky-looking mahogany body with a very short head of bubbly mocha froth.  Lacing is limited to a few micro-spots that escape the viscous sheeting that briefly stains the glass.  Once warm, the nose reveals a rich malt base of dark chocolate, caramel, stewed plums and rummy raisins.  It smells very fruit forward, with figs and dates also joining the fold.  Faded coffee lends just a bit of earthiness, while distant juniper-like spicing and perhaps a wisp of spruce tend to brighten things up a bit.  Its boozy, with notes of vanilla laden bourbon and maybe some mead-like fermented honey qualities.  The flavor is pulled together well, loaded with bittersweet dark chocolate, muddled dark fruits, and perhaps some earthen tobacco.  Coffee asserts itself a good deal more than the nose lets on, working along the green hop elements to add a rustic bitterness.  Burnt honey again creeps in on the back end, as does warming, heavily-wooded bourbon.  As expected, the palate is dense and boozy, lacking a bit in carbonation and missing out on some liveliness.  The finish is long, biting, and bittersweet.  Overall, its a solid brew, but it comes across overly syrupy and hot for my tastes.  Definitely a slow sipper to be split between a few folks.

Initially tall and puffy, a snow-white head recedes to a short but steadfast layer of foam, giving a solid wash but no lacing to the glass.  Immediately, the mandarin orange peel makes itself known and distinguishes itself from others within the Fantme Sant series, which has admittedly had a tendency to be somewhat similar in profile.  Juicy, oily orange rind lends a citrusy freshness to the underlying clean pilsner malt.  Hops are fresh and grassy, very green, yet with a pithy citrus bite.  Candy sugar is distinguishable, but better attenuated than a lot of other Fantmes tend to be.  Rounding out the nose is a soft, dry, white pepper spiciness.  The flavor is a bit sweeter, showing more of the white candy, along with sugar glazed orange rind and doughy pils malt.  Theres a touch of citrusy acidity, along with the drying yeast and spicy white pepper.  Hops are very green.  The palate is substantive, et sufficiently dried and quaffable (for a 7%er).  Carbonation is active, yet fine and soft, cleaning the tongue off quickly.

I cant tell if it smells more like a sweet glazed cake or a fancy soap.  I suppose its got a bit of both.  Flavors are just as sweet as the nose lets on, as honey and peppery, wintery mulling spices dominate.  Soapy lavender and cinnamon are prominent.  Candied citrus peel lends a bit of a bittersweet bite.  Theres a bit of a tea-like feel to this as well.  I almost feel like it should be warmed up and sipped slowly by the fire.
