Naso leggero e non troppo persistente, sentori di erba fresca, fiori di campo, qualche nota agrumata. In bocca il malto fa da padrone, sebbene bilanciato da un discreto amaro; lievi note erbacee e speziate sono donate dallo styrian golding.

Limpida (filtrata?), sorprendentemente rosso scuro-mogano. Un dito e mezzo di schiuma persistente color beige, con poche bolle a grana piccola. Aroma mediamente intenso e non eccessivamente persistente; caff tostato, agrumi, pino/resina. Carbonazione giusta, corpo medio-leggero. Amaro moderato ma piuttosto persistente. Roasted, cioccolato, caff, pompelmo, arancia, resina. Si sente lavena, alcol ben nascosto. Nel complesso ben equilibrata e con una discreta bevibilit nonostante lABV. Da provare.

I usually dont appreciate Black Ipa because of their excessively aggressive taste and their lack of equilibrium, but this one is really well balanced. Good job.

Very interesting beer, as an experiment. In my humble opinion lacks complexity and (a little more) balance. However something worthy to be remembered. ",58.905,HopHeadSamurai,Italy,4.5%,Birrificio del Ducato Koji Il Riso

Orangish with golden reflctions, pretty turbid. A little persistent foam layer with just some little bubbles. 
Aroma is pretty intense, but not particularly lasting. Marzipan and bread, canned fruit, raisin. 
Coming to tasting, I have to say: Great body! Really dense, almost creamy mouthfeel. Start sweet, then you can appreciate a sour note, then remains a medium, dry, persistent bitterness. We can distinguish fruit, sugar, spices (pepper). Alchol flavor is soft despite the ABV.

Amazing in its complexity, perfect for aging. ",99.365,HopHeadSamurai,Belgium,12%,De Dolle Stille Nacht
