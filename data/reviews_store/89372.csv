Matt Brewing Company,20," San Marcos, California",5,797,Porter,http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/mississippi-mud-black-tan/837/89372/,"The crafters hit the mark with me. The aroma keeps me coming back, The appearance is great and full of color in a frosty mug. I serve at room temp and place it slowly down the side of a frosty mug). To low a temp will kill the many great flavors and the snap at the end. As for the palate, a bit playfull, full body with a creamy smoooth slide. :-)

As for overall impression, I purchased 2 cases just to be sure I have some on hand. V/R Kent M. Whitney Master Chief, USN Retired
