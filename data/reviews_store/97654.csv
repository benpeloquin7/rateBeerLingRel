This canned pint of dank reminds me of ryeteous from sept. 2012 being distributed . Very rye oriented late hopped ipa with very one dimensional hops - may I say one trick pony ? I can say the basis of this beer could go somewhere - time to leave it in the hands of Bill Eye to improve it . Oh wait - 7cs was not that good to dry docks IIPA - Dougs a way better IPA brewer. Hope doing this Beer on that expensive copper brew rig works out- better stick to hefes and chads sours. Nice try! ( p. s.
