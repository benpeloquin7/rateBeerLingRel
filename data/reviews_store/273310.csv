The aroma is of fruit and hops and a hint of spiciness. Good taste with the fruit and hops getting top billing here, but not overpowering (in fact, maybe a little too muted?) Some peppery spice is blended well into the mix along with a sweet malt background, then finished dry. This beer is amply carbonated and finishes dry. I liked it. 8/9/13

An impressive head that while dense-looking, dissipates too quickly with no lacing. While the aroma is underwhelming, the mouth feel is pleasant and the taste is nicely balanced. The hops are sounding on key and not overpowering everything like some other beer cacophonies out there. There&apos;s nice citrus, pine and honey there, all with nice blending and balance. This beer is modest and maybe a little bashful like the nerdy but cute girl in gym class. She&apos;s not gonna give you a night you&apos;ll never forget, but she&apos;s classy and consistentand she&apos;ll keep you warm at night after the hop-heads burn out their taste buds.
