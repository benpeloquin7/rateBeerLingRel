It has a deceptive alcohol content of around 8 percent, which sneaks up on you. The appearance and aroma are heavy on the caramel, with a small head that leaves a little lace. Heavy alcohol content doesnt come through in the palate. A nice beer to sip over a long chat. ",,rplothow,Idaho,7.7%,Idaho Brewing Highland Scotch Ale
