The long durability (5 Months) indicates that its not a genuine Kellerbeer (bottled!).

By pouring it in a glass you can create much foam with pores of different sizes. By swinging the glass you can recreate some foam.
It smells of malt and hops, minimally fruity as you would expect from a (good) franconian Kellerbeer.
The taste is slightly sweet in front and has a nice hopsy bitterness in the back. More hopsy than the average franconian Kellerbeer.
Its a fullbodied beer with average carbonation that stays in your mouth for some time. Enough to drink it slowly without losing the taste.
Conclusion: The perfect franconian Kellerbeer at home. ",49.365,Recordjan,Germany,4.9%,Reh Zwickl

The best before date indicates that its made durable by heating it. So its not a genuine Kellerbeer.

The beer has a fine foam in the beginning that goes down quick. Leftovers of foam are staying till you drink it up, but you cant reproduce more foam by swinging the glass.

Aroma smells of mash (you can imagine the warm mash smell in front of the brewery) and not of hops. 

Appearance is nice: Its slightly muddy. Fine for an unfiltered beer.

The taste is too sweet for a Pilsener and not enough bitter.
The taste of mash is a bit too insistent.

Its a full bodied beer with soft carbonation and a disappointing finish.

Conclusion: Too much sweet malt and not enough hops. 
The awarded normal Kellerbier of the same brewery is much better! ",61.33,Recordjan,Germany,4.9%,Weiherer Keller-Pils
