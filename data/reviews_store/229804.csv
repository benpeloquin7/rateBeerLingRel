A decent beer that can be found around Shanghai. This particular pint seemed a bit off and oxidized. This seems to be happening more often and concerns me the beer is getting old. Regardless its still better than the macro lager crap from the big brewers. The alcohol is deceiving as its easy to drink for 6.6%.  ,88.545,Inferno2010,Oregon,6.2%,Rogue Dead Guy Ale

Lost of pleasant fruity aromas with a nice white rocky head in the pint glass. There is a slight note of alcohol but its rather drinkable for being 7.6%.
