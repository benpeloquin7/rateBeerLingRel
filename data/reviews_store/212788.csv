Smells exactly like it tastes- like alcohol. Ive only poured out two beers in my life and this was one of them. Absolutely disgusting. WAY too sweet with no interesting background flavors. It seems like it came out way too strong and they covered it by making it sweet. For the love of god avoid this. ,34.535,oipivo,Poland,7.5%,Olimp Kentauros

I honestly hated this beer. I tried it since I enjoyed their Hey Now and Crack, but they really missed the mark here.

Poured a nice amber color. The smell reminded me of sickingly sweet malts as well as maybe plums. As others have said it tasted exactly how it smelled. Very very sweet with a bitter overtone. The sweet plumish flavor stays on your palatte. It isnt an easy flavor to get rid of. Blech.

I finished the beer, but I had to chug it and immediately drink a different beer to wash the taste out of my mouth. Do yourself a favor and skip it. Grab one of their better beers mentioned above. ",50.294,oipivo,Poland,4.5%,Pracownia Piwa Like On Nick
