Nicely effervescent, the head does fall rather quickly... Notes of banana and cloves, just the way it ought a be. Taste is so rich, but balanced, the balance is truly why it works so well. Nicely creamy on the palate without being overly thick, definitely adds a richness and fullness to the beer. I lived in Wisconsin for 13 years and I miss it for many reasons, but the beer is tops. If you can get it, do so, this beer is spot on. ",99.046,eldub12,Wisconsin,7.2%,New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat
