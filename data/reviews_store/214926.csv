The beer is a bit cloudy, but overall not to bad looking with a nice foamy head.  Smells of nice fresh hops and semi sweet malt.  I didn&apos;t think this beer was all that impressive on my first sip, but after making a dent in my glass I really liked this beer.  From the ""dry hopped"" advertising on the label I was expecting a bit more hop forward taste at first I guess.  There are some nice hop flavors here, but more subtle than I expected.  I&apos;m not quite sure how to describe the hop character but it is well balanced fairly smooth and entirely drinkable.  I&apos;m ready for another one :-)

Beer is a bit cloudier than I would have liked, but overall not a bad looking beer.  Taste is not all that impressive, but it is quite drinkable.  I&apos;d gladly have another but will not be seeking it out again.  I get some pretty good malt flavors a with a bit of sweetness up front, not much in terms of hop flavor but there is a subtle bitter to the beer that ramps up as you swallow.  Overall pretty good amber but just another beer.
