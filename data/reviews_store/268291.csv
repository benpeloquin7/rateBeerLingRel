Aroma was indeed Cinnamon, nutmeg and spice. Chilled and poured into a snifter, at first taste the spices and pumpkin flavor were definitely present and blended very well not to potent and overwhelming and not to subtle and weak. As the beer started to warm a spiced rum taste started to appear and lingered on the palate. Again I highly enjoyed this beer and will be indulging in this while it lasts!

This beverage was rich in color and did taste like raspberry as promised. However the whole time it felt like I was drinking a Mikes hard or a raspberry puree.
