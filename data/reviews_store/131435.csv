This time Im getting so much jammy fig in the aroma, almost a super sweet scent.  I remember growing up we had real molasses on the table- that my family made, and sometimes it was really dark and sometimes a little lighter, but always sugary.  And thats what I taste in Third Coast Ale- a lot of molasses with that slightly bitter back of the palate burn, and a few over ripe fruits on top.  For me this is a starter (or finisher) but not more than 2 in one sitting.  ",99.418,SteveChicago,Michigan,10.2%,Third Coast Old Ale
