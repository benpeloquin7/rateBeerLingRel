This is a good everyday drinker.  Comparable if not better than yuengling lager. The lower alcohol level is due to no added sugar in the brewing process. My new flavor. The corn taste I ve seen in other reveiwsis due to the fact that straub uses corn flakes as one of their ingredients. I recommend it. ,18.335,Alcodrunk,Pennsylvania,4.1%,Straub American Amber Lager
