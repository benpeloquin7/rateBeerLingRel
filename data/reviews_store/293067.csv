This might very so be one of the worst porters Ive ever had. I wanted to like it, but the truth is I have had better peanut butter beers in my homebrew club. This one was poorly executed. It did have nice aroma, and if I could kick back and relax by sniffing beer all night it would be a winner, but I like to drink it as well and in this case, I regretted my decision to order it when I was about 4oz into my pint (worth noting, this should be served in a 10oz pour, not a pint).
