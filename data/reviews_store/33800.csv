I swear it was called numskull at the Applebees in Green Bay, but I did see that it said ""Leinies"" on the side of the tapper.  I have been looking for hints of this to show up in bottles somewhere, but havent seen anything.  I thought it was great.  My favorite Leinenkugel is the Red, but this may challenge that.
