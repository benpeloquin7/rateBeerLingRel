If like me, you like your cider flat, the 20 litre box is the best way to buy it as the bottled version is very slightly sparkling, probably due to being sealed with co2 for freshness. It has a strong taste of sweet apples and leaves a pleasant and slightly moreish after taste. 
Highly recommended. This is much better than most of the commercially available ciders, and though not available in shops, it is well worth finding one of the internet suppliers to purchase some. ",46.873,country_boy,England,5.2%,Abrahalls Thundering Molly
