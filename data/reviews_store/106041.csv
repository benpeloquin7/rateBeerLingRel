Pours a rich dark red amber with a medium frothy white head. Aroma of spruce, leather, soy sauce, caramel. Taste has a light sweetness, heavy bitter, and a touch of sour. Full body, a little thick, medium carbonation. Finish is long bitter that fades to a clean sweetness.

Overall the bitter hops and alcohol initially overpower the palate, making it somewhat overheated for the medium richness of this red. I would ask for more body and flavor, or a little less hops, to balance this. Perhaps some aging will bring this to nirvana. Some time left resting in the glass improves the balance. As it stands, the excellent finish keeps me sipping this to the end.

Tasting Note: When sampling the aroma, avoid drawing a full clod of the head into the nasal cavity. The carbonation mines the sinuses with astringent submunitions, followed by an explosion of piney darts between the eyes.

I would have been happy with a combination of light bitterness, pine, and citrus, but instead got tonic water with soap and a tangerine Lifesaver.
