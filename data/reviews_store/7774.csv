About the beer:  It pours a dark copper hue with a slight and quickly diminishing head.  The flavor tends toward a German Bock beer, but is a bit on the sweet and syrupy side.  The high alcohol content is obvious.  All in all, not a bad beer.  The price, at $6.99, for a sixer made it worth a try.  Probably wont be trying it again, though.
