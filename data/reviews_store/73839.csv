Poured a light copper color.  Head was about an inch and left a nice lacing down the sides of the glass.  The hops were very evident in the aroma, but I had to deduct a few points because I also noticed some ""off"" aromas.  The taste was wonderfully hoppy, but not too bitter.  The hops flavor remains through the aftertaste, but not much else.  Overall, I think this is a well-balanced ESB and I would definitely buy it again. ",42.195,GreenBeer,Washington,5.8%,Redhook ESB
