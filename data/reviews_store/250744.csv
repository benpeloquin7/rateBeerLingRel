Supposedly its 7.2%? Im not quite calling bullshit on that but I reckon the hops are hallucinogenic or otherwise adding to the alcohol buzz. One time I sunk a whole lot of this I ended up waist deep in the Pacific Ocean off New Brighton. No idea how I got there. One nasty wave and I could have drowned. Had to walk all the way back to Linwood too. No cab will take you when you smell like fish. Then there was that other time I found myself shirtless in the forest having scrawled indecipherable runes on myself in felt tip pen, carrying a sack of pine cones. That was an awful yet deeply spiritual experience. Anyway kids, drink responsibly. ",18.863,Mutante,New Zealand,7.2%,Harringtons Ngahere Gold

HOW TO PLAY WIZARD STICKS:

* Get a box of NZ Lager or something else that comes in the big cans.

* When you finish a can attach it to the bottom of the new one with gaffer tape.

* When there are no beers left, fashion helmets out of the boxes.

* Shove each other a bit and exchange insults until either party says I DECLARE WIZARD STICKS.

* Go down the park and have a big sword fight with the cans you have taped together.

* Get into a massive argument with your girlfriend.

* Dont be too upset because your mate has passed out and its therefore not too embarrassing.

* Realise that bitchy flatmate has been listening the whole time.

* Pray to whatever gods you believe in to strike you down. ",5.574,Mutante,New Zealand,5%,New Zealand Lager
