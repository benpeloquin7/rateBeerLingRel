Very dark with red tinge, fairly tight head, estery aromas with tinned prunes and roast barley. Big mouthfeel, with lots of fruity, caramelly malts and Christmas pud, balanced by an almost stout-like bitterness, giving a long, satisfying finish: a mighty brew that deserves wider recognition.

Amber, slightly hazy (which I dont mind), thick white head through use of sparkler, good lacing. Nice aroma of sugared grapefruit, with some yeastiness.

Deep golden, with medium white head, some lacing.
Aroma of sweet fruit salad, with grapefruit shining through.
Hops dominate flavour, the malts struggling perhaps due to relatively high percentage of wheat compared to barley malt: as a result, body is somewhat thin, but still fairly well balanced.
Overall, typical of the style, and very drinkable. ",80.757,NeilMcL,England,6.7%,Adnams Jack Brand Innovation IPA

Light malt and floral hop aroma, dense white head reflecting somewhat high carbonation of first pint served from cask; hence, good lacing.
Fine balance of biscuity malt and light hoppiness, good body for its gravity, with a mouthfeel suggesting a stronger ale; reminds me of a good pint of Theakstons Best Bitter.
