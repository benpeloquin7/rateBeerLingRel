Head dissipates quickly. Aroma is earthy and slightly citrusy, fresh. Taste is citrusy, good fruity yeast character, with a fair bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. Unfortunately the alcohol taste does come through a bit which I am not a fan of, but its not surprising at 8.5% ABV. Mouthfeel is surprisingly solid for such a light ale. Very dry toward the end though.. Good beer, but not at all what I expected. ",98.244,Healthire,Belgium,8.5%,Duvel
