At first taste your palate enjoys a bit of bitterness but that quickly gives way to an overwhelming sweetness that is defined by tastes of brown sugar, roasted cashews, and syrups. The sweetness lingers on the tongue but balances nicely over time. Overall an enjoyable well executed blonde beer, however it is a bit too sweet for my tastes.
