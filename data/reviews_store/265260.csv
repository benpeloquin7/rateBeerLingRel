Bright toasted orange color with just a small lack of head persistence. The taste is tangy and dank hops up front with a clean finish. Could use a touch of either brumalt or melanoidin. Caramel is faint, just barely there. Drinks quick and clean. A great surprise from a limited run house beer. ",,ysgard,Virginia,5.6%,Devils Backbone Wholistic Pale Ale
