Appearance was only slightly darker than an American lager.  Head was initially significant, but fizzled away quickly.  Taste was of stale malt with a definite alcohol precense (bottle stated 6.3% abv). Bought a sampler twelve-pack of JWD to try it out and other than the really attractive price, I was not impressed with any of its offerings.  As they say, you get what you pay for.  This might be a good beer to have around when you have undesireable house guests over and want to ""impress"" them with something different, while you save the good stuff for you and your close friends.
