One of the better imperal IPAs.  Good body.  i smell a lot of grapefruit on this one, but also some apricot and banana.  Very balanced aroma.  The balance continues in the flavor.  The beer is centered around the hops, as any Imperial IPA should be, and they dominate, but there is an underlying malty flavor that is firm and provides much of the body, but is less assertive than the hops.  Finish is all clean hops.  An excellent brew.   ",99.788,mnbeerguy,Delaware,9%,Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA
