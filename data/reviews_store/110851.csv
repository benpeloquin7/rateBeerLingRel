Pours a decent red, but Ive seen better in brews like Great Divide Hoss. Aroma is ripe with barley and wheat. The mouthfeel is a bit too sharp with carbonation, but is still enjoyable. The taste is of barley and pine with the expected red ale aftertaste. Overall a decent brew, but not a particularly memorable one.  ",77.361,jpknowl,Missouri,5.8%,Boulevard Irish Ale
