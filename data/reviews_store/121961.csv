Maybe something a little extra added, who knows. It tastes, feels and looks like a normal Dahls, only this one is on steroids. The aroma is dominated by the crazy lager yeast that Dahls uses and the 6,5% ABV is certainly noticeable as a tingling in the mouth. I didnt become an instant fan, and went back to normal Dahls after one pint in lack of other beers. Tasted on Bari, Trondheim three days ago. This one will only be available on tap in the middle of Norway Ive heard. ",,magnusgb,Norway,6.5%,Dahls Eksport
