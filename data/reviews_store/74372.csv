Poured into a chalice from a 0.33 L bottle, the color was a pleasing ruby/mahogany.
But the smell.... ugh! I was smacked in the face with an aroma of rancid vinegar and rotten fruit.
The taste was pretty much the same - very sour, slightly bitter and yes, vinegary and rancid!
Like the person below me said, it has a rotten fruit-like impression. This is not a good thing in my opinion.
My mom took a sip of it and said she would vomit after a full glass.
Anyway, I managed a full glass, but it was not pleasant. 
Never again. ",98.405,berlintronix,Belgium,6%,Rodenbach Grand Cru

After pouring a 0.5 L bottle into a chalice, the smell of dark fruits, coffee and freshly baked bread is immediately apparent. 
The appearance is dark, ruby-brown, almost cola-like with a small creamy, khaki head.
Taste has wonderful hints of caramel, figs and brown sugar. Very complex. Its a ""chewy"" beer, yet incrediably smooth. 
Basically zero taste of alcohol, which is amazing, considering the 7.1 % abv. Be careful with this one, it will catch up with you very quickly!
It has a surprising amount of carbonation, which makes for great drinkability. 
This is an outstanding beer, brewed by one of the last remaining monastic breweries in Germany. A must try! ",98.62,berlintronix,Germany,7.1%,Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel
