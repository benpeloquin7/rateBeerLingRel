:::APPEARANCE::: dark reddish brown, just like maple syrup, head was very minimal but was a nice thick creamy texture::: AROMA::: I could smell it from 3 ft. away, cherries, sweet and malty, berries, grapes, and citrus hops:::TASTE:::bread-like malt and bitterness up front, then sweet malts followed by a slowly developing hop bitterness that lasts for awhile, despite the citrus hops in the aroma, there were none in the taste:::MOUTH-FEEL:::medium/thin body, syrupy, modest carbonation_____Honestly, I expected better. The aroma was the best thing about DB. I like bitterness, but something throws me off in this one. I think maybe the bitterness persists too long, after the first taste it just wouldnt leave and ruined other flavors.

This ones pretty good but is lacking in a few areas. First off, for an Imperial IPA, the flavor should have been some what stronger. While pleasant, it just didnt hold up as long as say, the 90minute. Second, it just wasnt bitter enough. And third, it was rather watery.

Following Stones advice I prepared a pb&j; and cracked my bomber open. I ended up enjoying the sandwich more...

Im a big fan of Stone but this was just awful. SSP had a rusted metal, olive scent. Taste was of smoked rotten olives and beef. There wasnt an ounce of chocolate, vanilla or anything enjoyable in there. Mouth feel was okay but rather thin. When I started on the sandwich it  brought out the alcohol flavor and made things worse.

Smell: Very nutty, nice hazelnut aroma with a little bit of caramel and chocolate.

Taste: Not sweet, not bitter.  What I got was a very mellow, creamy, nutty flavor, not strong at all. It reminds me of a hazelnut coffee with way too much cream so that a lot of the intense flavor is gone. Minuscule hop presence. Aftertaste is nutty then roasted coffee.
Flavor is good but if it packed the appeal of the smell it would be great.
