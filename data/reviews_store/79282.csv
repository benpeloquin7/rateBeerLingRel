The appearance was dark brown/amber color with tight tan carbonation clinging head. The taste was rich, malty, with bready Belgian & caramel malts, molasses, spicy esters, sugars/alcohol - very rich and complex. Gets more complex as it warms up too. Mouthfeel is full bodied with big malts. Overall a great beer which complements this style by being rich, complex and warming. It has all the aforementioned flavors of raisin, prunes, dark fruit, & esters.  ",99.365,Ozzyj,California,12%,AleSmith Decadence 2012

Orange/amber color with slight chill haze.  Nice malt backbone with hop bitterness present.  Not astringent without any noticeable diacetyl.  Has a dry finish with a smooth alcohol flavor present.  Medium body with no astringent flavors.  Clean, drinkable 2xIPA - it is well hopped and balanced with the malt backbone.  More aroma hops and perhaps more assertive flavor hops would make this beer score higher.   ",90.258,Ozzyj,California,9.25%,Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA

Limited carbonation - to light brown ring.  The aroma is rich malt, complex with a smokiness imparted by the use of smoked malts - nice.  I dont typically like smoked beers as they taste like they have been poured through a charcoal grill - but this is a very well balanced beer.  The flavor changes as it warms up from a toasted, chocolate, coffee and hop balance with a burnt wood taste thought the middle.  Overall, a intense flavored RIS - big, dark ale with roasty, fruity, and bittersweet flavors per the style with a light smoke presence.   ",98.19,Ozzyj,Pennsylvania,10.8%,Weyerbacher Fifteen
