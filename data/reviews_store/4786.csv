Has a deep amber colour, although the head disappears perhaps a little too fast for my taste.  The aroma of banana is pronounced, but it doesnt overwhelm the flavour of what is a perfectly servicable ale - in fact, the banana flavour seems well integrated and balanced by a hoppy bitterness.  Wouldnt drink it every day, but have had it since and will certainly be trying it again. ",36.087,mattaku99,England,5.2%,Wells Banana Bread Beer (Bottle)
