No length in its finish and forgettable when its swallowed. Lacking in aroma apart from the apparent toffee like taste which can be smelt.

Probably slightly biased on this one (being Irish) but jesus, if you get a decent pint of this stuff it can turn any normal day into one of the best nights of your life. The Irish know that Guinness doesnt travel well beyond the emerald isle. But you can still get a good pint in other countrys. It seems the further you go, the worst it gets. Perhaps this is because there isnt as high demand in other countries for it (probably 2 - 6 being poured every hour in a normal-ish busy foreign ""Irish"" bar, whereas normal domestic bars it could be anywhere from 10 - 20+ per hour). A consistent flow makes for better beer that hasnt been sitting in the lines for a long time. In Britain, they used to (still do in places) pour it straight into the glass (disregarding its settle time) and serve it directly to the customer which earned Britain (this, and other obvious things) a bad name for upon Irish people (never mind the IRA, dont mess with our Guinness lads, and well be grand). Anyway, with a good draught pour, Guinness can be an other world experience if done right. A nice price, in the right glass with a consistent pour and a head just brimming above the harp, you know straight away when the Guinness is good. After the first little tester sip, you determine the bitterness of the pint, the coldness and overall drinkability, and with this, if she passes, you slug away about a quarter of the pint in one go, leaving only a little thin white mustache above your lip and unquenchable desire for more. Beautiful is all I can say. It brings a tear to my eye. *Warning. I am Irish and possibly biast* ",80.547,chrisardcath,Ireland,4.2%,Guinness Draught

Full bodied and heavy for beer in general, but at this percentage, it feels moderately bodied and oily on the tongue. Very nice. 2 or 3 of these and youll sleep like a baby.  ",91.568,chrisardcath,California,9.9%,Lagunitas Imperial Stout
