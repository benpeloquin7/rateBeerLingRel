Great aroma of banana, citrus, and spices. Pours with a nice head that lingers througout. Not much lacing on the glass. Sweet banana flavor with hints of clove and wheat. A great beer after a long hard day at work... Or anytime really! Crisp finish. 

Ive tried a lot of Hefes and this one has got to be one of my favorites. The only thing better than this (that you can still easily get in the states) is the Dunkel version.

If youre a fan of REAL Hefeweizens, this one will disappoint you. Its not a bad beer, but not a good Hefe. The Germans would be laughing at this. Not much of an aroma.  Slightly fruity, but not much else. 1/2"" head when poured that disappears quickly. Same lacing as most other Sam Adams beers. A dark golden color with hints of orange. Cloudy. Sweet on the tongue and citrusy. Maybe a touch of clove but not much. Sweet finish. Tastes and looks almost like Blue Moons adapatation of a Belgian Witbier than it does a true Hefe. I dont know about you other folks, but Im not so sure Sam Adams deserves the notoriety they have. I think they brew mostly average beers.

Slightly sweet and very malty at first taste and then you get hit with a big smokey flavor, leaving a dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. Fruit and caramel hints give way to this dry finish. Feels good on the palate, but Id love a smoother finish.  ",63.437,kingsleaze,Massachusetts,5.4%,Samuel Adams Scotch Ale
