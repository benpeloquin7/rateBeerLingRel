In fact, it almost reminded me an ordinary schwag beer. But, the taste makes up for it. I agree with the tame version of a SN beer. Great balance here. Is quite drinkable and worth trying once, some will like more than others.  ",85.458,umphan,California,5.9%,Sierra Nevada Early Spring Beer (ESB)

Ive got 10 bottles of the first run left in my basement, they age great. This years run says ""brewed with honey"" on the label is the only real difference. A local place here bought a keg for $220.00 and it could be better off of the tap. Im not sure though, I bought a case of this years batch and from the bottle to my HQ crystal pilsner glass it smells just as juicy. Enjoy! ",99.947,umphan,Michigan,10%,Bells Hopslam
