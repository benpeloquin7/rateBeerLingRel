Persistent head, clear. Suspect the overriding factor in the design was alcohol percentage. Alcohol dominates, slightly malty. Ive had 7% beers which taste much milder, this is emphatically not in that category. Hops are difficult to find, although I suspect a fair few will have been used. Random fact: burped and tasted honey after drinking. If this was the idea, the brewer is sublime. If, as is most likely, this was unrelated to the beer, it has resulted in an undeserved boost to my rating. Please see future reviews to find out if it was an anomaly ",,Ingulund,England,7%,Five Towns Plaistow Patricia
