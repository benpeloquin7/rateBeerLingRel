Smells like coffee does in an old-folks home, plus marshmallow? Though I dont smell the alchohol I can taste it and feel it in the nose, down my throat, not unpleasant. Tastes of coffee kinda salty and roasted even peppery, not very sweet fairly bitter. Its a great brew to drink when you thought youve tasted it all. I will have to age this one for sure.

P.S. Yes its the same rating but the error will be corrected, my mistake ",99.524,TavisKirgg,Denmark,13.1%,Mikkeller Black Hole
