More like a slightly carbonated wine with a bit of barley flavor.  Odd color, looked like someone poured a bit of dark lager into a wine.  Popped it, and I was hit by the sweet smell of the grapes and honey.  Took a swig, knew I was in for something different.  Couldnt detect the 9% alcohol, which I was impressed by.  Still, far too fruity for me, even with the distinct barley aftertaste.  It had the distinct grape and honey flavor, which is not what I look for in a beer.  I dislike fruity beers.  Not as sweet as mead, not as fruity as wine, not bitter and hoppy enough to be a beer.  Felt like it didnt know what it wanted to be.  I give it a fairly high rating because it is unique, and certainly good for what it is.  Would I buy it again?  Heck no.  For the same price I can get a four pack of the 90 IPA or a single World Wide Stout. ",89.339,paulkstadden,Delaware,9%,Dogfish Head Midas Touch Golden Elixir

It has good initial flavor, like a fermented bottle of nuts, but its that aftertaste that grabbed me.  I had it too cold, but as time wore on, the beer livened up as it warmed up.  Not particularly thick to the tongue, and perhaps too much carbonation for me, but at least the carbonation was lass of a factor as the beer waned.  To sum up, if you see a six pack of this, and want a good general dark beer, pick it up.  Good nut flavor with excellent wood aftertaste, but let it warm up a little.

The first beer that ever really caught my taste buds.  The first thing that struck me was its appearance.  I was used to seeing light, pale, watery type beers.  Then my cousin pours this into my glass, and I thought is coffee, it was so dark.  The head looked heavenly and wonderfully frothy.  My first sip was like tasting breakfast.  Wonderful loaf of fresh bread taste, coffee, barley, and was delightfully thick (for someone just having his first dark beer).  It stuck to my tongue and had an excellent dark, British bitter after taste, like chewing on the bark of an oak tree.  As time went on and the glass emtpied, it warmed up and increased in richness and smoothness, even as the carbonation died.  For a beer that is generally available in just about every store, it cant be beat. ",80.547,paulkstadden,Ireland,4.2%,Guinness Draught

Temperature.  I opened up the 12 ounce can to be greeted with no real odor other than a cold bathwater smell.  Carbonation seems like its a Sprite thats been out for a week.  Incredibly watery, with a bit of bitter aftertaste that gives hint of beer.  Somewhat grain aftertaste.  No alcohol feel, and certainly does not ""grip"" my tastebuds.  I actually didnt finish it, I got halfway and poured the rest out.  I may as well have been drinking flat seltzer.  My friend drank the rest of the sixpack and experienced no buzz effect whatsoever.  So, it doesnt even fulfill its basic goal of being a cheap beer, which is to infuse a person with enough alcohol to feel slightly relaxed. ",1.618,paulkstadden,California,5%,Pabst Blue Ribbon
