Even though ive seen a couple people think the same thing I did when I tried this. When we first opened the bottle and poured it into a glass we could already smell its aroma. It smelled of raw hotdogs, this was a bad start for this beer. So we all tried it, luckily we only bought one in a make your own six pack. We all agreed that it tasted just like bologna and there was not one of us that was willing to drink the rest of it so we had to do what we hate to do with beer and poured it out. Troegs has a great line up and I love a lot of their beers but this one just was unbearable. Im hoping it just was a bad batch or maybe its just a very unique taste. I feel bad for this being my first review of a beer on this site but ill be sure to come back with more positive reviews on beers next time.
