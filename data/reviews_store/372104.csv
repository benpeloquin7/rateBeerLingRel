The nose was malty molasses and dark fruits: not overly strong but easy to pick out.
The taste simular to the aroma, malty and fruity, almost a fruity malt loaf sort of flavour, but not as thick or rich.
Medium body feel, would have prefered a deeper depth of flavours and a slicker/thicker feel to the beer: still OK but could easily be a lot better. ",40.258,RRnRA,Wales,4.5%,Brains The Rev James (Bottle)
