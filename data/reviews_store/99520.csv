Dont know where to start but i will start of, the colour is incredibly rich and dark, a little ruby like. The aroma is fantastic and can only remind you of where it came from, the craftsmanship gone in and is rich in caramel, coffee like hints and butterscotch is what i seem to find. Going on with the taste, which is very abundant and just as good as the aroma. Very smooth and still so full of spicey yet subtile dark flavours. A perfect example of appearance, taste and experience. Making an appointment at the st. sixtus abbey soon to pick up another stack! ",,1nsane,Belgium,10.2%,Westvleteren 12 (XII)
