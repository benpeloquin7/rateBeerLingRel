The aroma is very pleasant, slight hints of honey or candied sugar, and then even fainter notes of apricot or peach. The hoppy florals are herby and spicy, and nicely pronounced with each whiff.

My first taste cleared the palate.  Alcohol was very noticeable but then faded. I was a little sad I didnt notice anything else. Next drink, I really got the spices, particularly cardamom, possibly also coriander. With each following sip, the high alcohol level made itself known then tried to mask itself under the spices. In the end, it failed to balance the alcohol well enough. 

The mouth feel was excellent, bordering medium to full bodied. The bittering hops fought until the end with the other flavors and I was left with the finish of a complex and not altogether pleasing aftertaste. 

Fun to try, not worth the 13.5 euro I spent. ",97.152,justVASGO,Belgium,10%,Chimay 150 / Spciale Cent Cinquante

Color is nice amber, pours with a thick beige head. Clarity has chill haze.  The more I drink it the more Im seeing this is a solid bitter category ale.  Taste starts slightly sweet on the tongue, then a balanced maltiness, then the bitter presents itself subtly. Mouth feel is full, palate almost approaching creamy but backing off. Average carbonation.  

Its relieving to see the yeast at the bottom of the bottle! Makes it feel like this is a home brew. Good beer all around, ESPECIALLY for birra italiana. ",36.702,justVASGO,Italy,5.5%,San Gabriel Ambra Rossa di Treviso

Nice, light golden color and a white head that goes away in 20 seconds. Sweetness is nicely balanced.  Big apple taste, semi-dry finish. Something strange though with the overall taste that I cant pin down.  Estery? Cant stand ciders that are sweet and this one didnt turn me off on that level.  Nice to try, but still prefer Strongbow, Magners and K over Baladins version.   ",54.405,justVASGO,Italy,4.5%,Baladin Sidro

Ive had a french cider that had hints of this off-flavor and it was fine with the crepes and oysters french meal.  This cider, however, could be better without such off-flavors.  Other than that, thought this was good.  Nicely dry, good light amber color. No head. Aroma is the Band-Aid. Taste is the same but the blend of apples comes through balancing the phenolic taste but not enough for my critical palate.  Fine choice for a single try, but wont go back to it.
