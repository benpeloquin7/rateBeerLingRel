Served extremely cold, might not have helped.
Aroma has a caramel nose and the usual hops. Appearance is nice and dark. This beer packs a strong punch in bitterness, both from the hops and from the roasted malt. It tasted a little too ""burned"" for me. Not as refined as it could have been, hopefully the great guys at BBP can improve it! ",93.971,malmostoso,Belgium,6.66%,Brussels Beer Project Dark Sister

Its a very uninteresting beer, with little flavour and not even a hint of bitterness to make it at least refreshing.
A waste of a drink, Im afraid.
The only redeeming quality is the low alcohol content, making it OK to drink if you dont want to get sloshed. ",8.761,malmostoso,New Zealand,4%,Crafty Beggars Pale and Interesting

The bitterness of the beer is great and balanced by the malts. After every sip the bitterness lingers on the tongue inviting to go back for more.

The beer pours with little head and a lovely dark amber color. The choice of glass is also perfect.
Citrusy notes are strong, but not much else comes to the nose.
Not very bitter, it kind of lost some appeal after the first few sips, not giving that need to go back for more common to many PAs.
Its advertised as a German version of an American Pale Ale, and I can see why, but the low hops let the beer down for me. ",40.703,malmostoso,Germany,5.2%,Schnbuch Pale Ale

Aroma is very citrusy, and the beer pours with plenty of head in an orange and clear way. Sourness is just what youd expect, but its not bitter and its very very pleasant. Very carbonated, with a bit of an astringent finish. My girlfriend, who hates geuze, thinks it has a Brut Champagne-y finish and I agree, its very very pleasant.
It continues in the 2009 tradition, exceptional Geuze that for me rivals with Mariage Parfait. ",99.206,malmostoso,Belgium,7%,HORALs Oude Geuze Mega Blend
