This beer distinguishes itself by the perfect balance between malt and hop taste. The taste is full enough for a pilsener (not too watery), but also smooth and not too bitter in the end. Although you certainly notice a smooth slightly bitter hop taste.

Good quality. Like the fact that it comes in a dark glass bottle, in contrary to many other mass production beers. Feel that this will keep the beer from developing taste deviations.

You will like this beer if you like smooth pilseners, that still have some character to it. You might not like it so much if you do not like hop taste, or prefer a very strong bitter aftertaste.
