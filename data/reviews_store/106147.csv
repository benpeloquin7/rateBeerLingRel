It has a strong cherry flavor, reminiscent of cough drops, with just a hint of vanilla.  This beer pours a cloudy maroon color and served over ice has little no no visible carbonation.  First few sips youll pickup a light spritz but ultimately its thin and almost watery in texture.

Right up front youll get the cherries and just a hint of tartness (not the strong tart you get in most krieks.)  Theres some vanilla too but I had trouble finding the cinnamon, clove and honey accents mentioned on the bottle.

Excellent desert beer - looking forward to trying it warmed as suggested by the brewer. ",97.096,WildBil2me,Canada,8%,Unibroue Quelque Chose
