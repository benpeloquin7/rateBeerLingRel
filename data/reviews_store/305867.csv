Good head at first quickly dissipates to pencil thin white rim. Good carbonation from the center bottom of the glass. Slight orange and spice aroma and taste, with a dry slightly bitter finish. Not much stick on the lacing A 
nice beer that is better consumed with food Their hefe&apos;s are considerably closer to style.

Hazy pale amber/ orange slight citrus bouquet first sip reminded me of an IPA rather than cream ale, pencil thin head floats all the way to the bottom of the glass , crisp bitterness lasts for quite a while  ",71.703,Kobi1,New York,5.2%,Sixpoint Sweet Action
