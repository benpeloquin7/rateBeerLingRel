This is just as or more spectacular than the previous. A truly amazing beer. Honestly, where the best wine always needs food, the most amazing beers, most often, I find, despise pairings. The Mad River Steelhead Double IPA is almost a full meal in and of it self.

Appearance: Hazy brick gold with a gold hue, like burnt caramel. There is significant sediment floating in the glass that all settles to the bottom if not consumed quickly (and why would you rush through this glass)

Nose: begins with a slight vegetal note of sweet green beans and roasted yellow corn quickly slipping into a rich demi glaze with bright florals and brown sugar.

Palette: Rich and creamy. Minimal head but beautifully rich with molasses and candied plum. Very filling, though. Dont plan on following this with anything afterwards.   ",90.995,lgreer84,California,8.6%,Mad River Steelhead Double IPA
