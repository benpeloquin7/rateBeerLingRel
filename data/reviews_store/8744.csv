But did you know the Samoan Vailima is brewed and bottled under German management? Since 1998 Vailima has been exported to Europe and, believe it or not, in 1998 Vailima won an award in Brussels/Belgium. The brewery itself is owned by Carlton and United Breweries of Australia. Personally, sometimes affordable quantity supersedes quality. Especially when entertaining family or boiling on a Samoan beach.
