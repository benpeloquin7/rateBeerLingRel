Nose is espresso, sweet malts, sea water, and chocolate. Palate is light yet soft with a slight effervescence. Taste starts out like a traditional english ale, and then blooms to complexity. Banana in the middle of the bell in the back of the palate, liquorice, chocolate, seaweed. Finishes with a note slight note of espresso bitteness that lingers. Tasty, complex, intriguing, drinkable, unique, a very nice beer worth picking up or adding rum or a nice peated scotch/ sweet bourbon to.

I do like a good english ale and this one lacks certain qualities. Nose is slightly fruity, citrus perhaps with a light malt profile. On the palate it is effervescent and has the beginning of a nice ale. However, there is no finish outside of a slight dryness. But there is potential in this beer! Throw a little higher loveibond malt in with the Otter malts, and a little more bittering hops to round out the finish and aroma, I think would make this a fine English ale. As it is, decent summer beer with a nostalgic label. ",28.376,Jasonr3,England,4.7%,Black Sheep Monty Pythons Holy Grail (Bottle)
