Perfect amount of carbonation.  Has an extremely balanced malt to hop profile.  Yet you can definitely taste the hops pretty strongly.  Very little alcohol taste from a 10% beer.  Really impressed, very good beer.  Citra hops so you know its gonna be fruity.  Has a slight bitter twinge at the end but very low actual bitterness.
