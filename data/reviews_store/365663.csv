I enjoy beer that is refreshing and smooth with no bitter aftertaste. This beer delivered all that for me. It has a pleasing aroma or I wouldnt have drank it. It was delightfully crisp and had a lovely golden appearance in a beautiful green bottle which matched the shirt I was wearing. I will definitely be adding this beer to my Top Picks. Thank you Saskatchewan for giving this Prairie girl something to enjoy for years to come. The End. ,11.895,Qanuck,Canada,5%,District Ms Knuckle Premium Pale Lager
