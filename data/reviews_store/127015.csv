A delicious, mellow golden blend subtly combining a noble hop taste with a smooth yet aromatic finish.
The origins of the brew is also legendary originating from the Maori God Tawhikiwhiki. He created the blend when attempting to rid the nation of evil. Once all evil was smashed on the concoction, life was fantastic in the Land of the Long White Cloud.
A great night starter, a great night finisher, a great pick up line; pure and simple a brew for all ages. ",,therapehouse,New Zealand,4%,Southern Gold Lager
