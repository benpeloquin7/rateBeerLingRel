Before you actually taste, Abbey Quad is basically what this beer does. As it pours, sits in the tulip, laces, carbonates, and smells (at fridge temp) its Abbey all day. So much biscuit - also a ton of malt, maybe even a doppel bock sniff or two. Basically no signs yet of IPA OR hops.
Once you let it warm to the right temp and take a sip... yea not so much IPA. 
I actually enjoy this, my second one (had the first 3 nights ago) and would still buy and enjoy under a more accurate heading - but cant seem to find much of what youd come to expect in strong IPAs.

Nose, palate, taste, and aftertaste all superb. Very juicy palate, reminds me of Heddy Topper on mouthfeel (although quite different in most other regards). Just so much to appreciate here. Time for my first sip.  ",99.418,Belgian22,California,10.4%,Sierra Nevada Hoptimum

When I looked it up, the first review gave me a laugh, so Im still chuckling over the aroma of beggin strips. 
That said, yes, I can see where that may be slightly possible, but for me this is much more reminiscent of my standby doppel from Ayinger. Sure its even sweeter and not quite as balanced, but for who its made by I have to say this isnt bad. 
Firm, somewhat lively carbonation, heavier mouthfeel, plenty of dough and malt all day. I think the nose and color are the strongest qualities here. 
Overall, not too subtle, but absolutely worth a go, especially at $6 for 22oz.

Years ago I got into the Racer 5 and as a result have always considered this a solid brewery. 

My review is on the last bottle of my four pack. This model is a ruby color, akin to an abbey dubbel, great lace, bit heavy on the mouthfeel, tons of sedimentary particles to admire in the light. I refrain from even sipping this guy until 30-40 minutes out of fridge. This brings the aromas and flavor development to really start striding from the moment I taste. Well balanced, but on the sweeter side - as alluded the palate is a bit on the syrup side so that lines up - at 18% rye content you can detect a bit of that extra kick of (hot) spice, but Id love to see what a higher percentage might do, being a fan of distilleries like High West and Whistle Pig.

The color is a nice burnt copper, lacing is really thick and lasting - so I expected more suds on the palate. Not quite as lively as I expected. The nose is really well-done, see other reviewers with better vocabularies for fuller deScription. The taste has a much better balance than most. Bitterness and sweetness do battle, but whichever is winning from moment to moment is irrelevant because you are enjoying the experience.
