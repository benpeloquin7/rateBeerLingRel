This beer really didnt raise itself above that expectation.  However, with that said, this was a very enjoyable lager!

Its listed under stouts, but it is really a black ale.  It feels like drinking a flat watered down coke at first.  However, once the beer settles on the palate it surprises you with a bite of flavor.  The flavor and aroma resemble burnt coffee before beer, but not entirely bad.  If it was labeled as a kind of coffee ale, I wouldnt like it any more, but the flavor and aroma would seem less accidental. ",,Steve_Brew,Kentucky,5.5%,Bluegrass Gloom Sucker Black Ale
