Nice hazy copper color with a nice frothy white to off-white two finger head with excellent retention and nice somewhat spotty lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus hops with some malt coming through. Taste starts with a slightly sweet malt flavor almost such as in a amber ale that quickley goes to a nice piney hop with a moderately bitter citrus hop finish that is nice and dry. The somewhat moderate carbonation allows this beer to go down nice and smooth. Overall this is a very solid APA and is nicely ballanced and as complex as anyone can except from an APA. Recommended but at $9 for a 22oz bottle will not be seeking out on a regular basis.  ,97.041,Jleach86,Colorado,6.1%,Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale
