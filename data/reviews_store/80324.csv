Bottle has a drawing of a balding monk with a very good beer in his hand. 

Appearance: In my limited experience, this sets the standard for strong dark ales. A deep orange-brown color, almost completely opaque. The head never really disappears from the top of the beer. 

Smell: This beer smells better than the smell of any other beer which my nose has smelled. Smells like fresh bread, with strong malty tones. 

Taste: This is possibly the best-tasting beer Ive tried to date. If I go fat and bald from drinking this beer, its worth the price. God bless the monks from Westvleteren, who apparently created the recipe for this beer. God bless also the brewers at Watou who make this intense stuff. The beer is full-bodied, and leaves a coating in your mouth (a good thing). Im not that good at picking out individual flavors, but I can taste sweet fruity flavors (plums, grapes, and bananas) with malt (chocolate and bread). I poured this below the temperature recommended on the bottle (52-56F), and I think the taste becomes more intense as the liquid warms.  ",99.894,TurdFurgison,Belgium,10%,St. Bernardus Abt 12
