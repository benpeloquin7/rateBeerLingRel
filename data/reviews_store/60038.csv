It is a brew that is made with rassberries involved. It is a great all around fruit brew and here is my review:

Appearance: The appearance is a beer that is ""silty"" and unfiltered. It has a slight ruby hue to it and caps off nicely with a finger width head.

Smell: Fruity, that of rassberries and hops

Taste: The taste is crisp and refreshing. The rassberries don not over take the beers natural hoppieness. Very flavorfull

Mouthfeel: The carbonation in this brew is low so that you can really guzzle it down with no carb-burn. Good taste with very little aftertaste.

Drinkability: This is a brew that I would drink again. I would rather order it in the bottle to go though, I will explain upon reviewing the joint.

I always just buy one...then if I dont like it, I didnt buy a whole pack. Here is my review of this American Porter:

Aroma: The aroma was a hard one to nail down because so many notes stood out for me; chocolate, coffee and nuttiness all were components in this brew. Very high Malt smell.

Appearance: When I poured this porter into my glass is was a very dark brown and when I held it up to the light the edges where a dark ruby, according to BJCP style guidelines is a must. The head was a two finger widith tan color and it sustained all the way through.

Flavor: The flavor is quite mellow w/o a tinge of hops. Rosted malt, chocolate and coffee stand out as the foremost tastes that hit my pallette. The brew is absent to fruity or bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Very deep and pillowy. Low carbonation. I noticed that the carbonation from the head laced down the glass quite nicely.

Drinkability: This brew is definately drinkable. It is a nighttime drink in my opinion and would go well with a dark chocolate desert as a food pairing.

Excellent example of an American Porter, I would have another.

Many of my friends would never take the time to drink a beer that hand a fruity flavor put in it on purpose. Me...on the other had likes to try new things. 90% of the time I am right. Here is my review:

Aroma: The aroma was of great distiction to the apricot. It was a medium aggressive apricot smell. The hops smell has been subdued due to the complimenting apricot tones.

Appearance: The look was great. The base tone was that of a hefe weizen. Due to that, the clarity was noticibily weizen in apperance. The color took on a slight orange tinge from the apricot.

Flavor: Wow, this is what sets this brew apart. I have never tasted a fruit beer where the balance between the base brew ( weizen ) and the apricot, but this brew did it.

Mouthfeel: Due to the basestyle being hefe weizen and the apricot adding flavor, it was very light and crisp. Apricot aftertaste as well.

Drinkability: The overall impression left me wanting more. I grabbed only one bottle, that is how I test a beer...why buy a 6 pack when you discover you hate it...costly mistake. This is a great fruit beer for those that like apricot and hefe weizen...a beer/fruit marriage made in Brew Heaven.

Apperance: The apperance was very nice. The carbonation could be seen at the bottom with several strans of bubbles floating to the surface. Nice amber/red tint to it. 

Smell: Excellent smell of strawberry 

Taste: I was really suprised. The strawberry was a great addition to this blonde. It was light, but that is what you expect from a blonde. 

Mouthfeel: I really wanted to keep it in my mouth for a while. As your mouth warmed it up it increased in flavor. 

Drinkability: Damn fine flavored/blonde brew that I would recommend to those that like blonde/cream ales.

Presentation: 12 oz short/stubby bottle. Nice lable, no freshness date found.

Aroma: The aroma was unlike a chocolate porter in smell. The roasty nuttiness of the malt was presant.

Appearance: The brew poured a very dark brown with ruby edges where very little light poured in. It poured a nice two finger light tan head that produced nice lacing through the session.

Flavor: This is what really stood out for me. The creaminess of the carmel and toffee flavor was a delight. The malt was very strong but not overpowering by the roasted taste to it.

Mouthfeel: No carbonation that I could tell. Low mouth feel.

Overall Impression: This is one of my favorites so far, out of the ones that you can get locally here in Oregon. I would drink this brew occasionally...if not weekly.

Aroma: Dark chocolate and more dark chocolate. This brews aroma was like smelling a dark chocolate candy bar. Sweet and creamy were also present.

Appearance: Again the color was that of a dark chocolate bar. The head poured a very dark brown that provided great lacing down the glass. Very dark...smooth appearance.

Flavor: I cannot express what it tasted like except this: Take a Hersheys dark chocolate bar, melt it, and add it to a very dark stout base...then add a dark cream to it...ohh so yummy.

Mouthfeel: Like drinking dark chocolate milk. Smooth, smooth and creamy smooth.

Overall Impression: This brew is ontop of the Chocolate Stouts that I have had in the past. I would/will tell everyone about this stout. Would be wonderful with a chocolate desert or over icecream even.

Aroma: The aroma was of strong coffee and dark chocolate. No real hop aroma to be found.

Appearance: The brew poured into my glass a dark cola color. No ruby highlights could be seen on the sides. The head was a medium tan color and was about a finger width. Carbonation was very low to none.

Flavor: This brew tasted like coffee and roasted coffee beans. The taste has a bit of a ""bite"" to it, though after about two drinks, that goes away. The burnt coffee taste also shoots to the foreground and really sets this brews taste apart from others.

Mouthfeel: Not harsh nor bitter. No carbonation bite. Smooth and very very dark feeling.

Overall Impression: This is a damn fine example of a Master Brewer strutting his craft and knowing how to brew a craft beer. I really dont understand how some could give it such a low review as they have done...but to each his own...this is a dman fine brew.

I drove the 20 miles north to The Pelican Pub and Brewery to sample this fine brew that I had heard so much about. Scottish Ales are my most favorite brew style and one taste of this brew proves why I like this style. I had them refill my growler from the tap and also picked up a bottle of this brew to review later. Here is my review:

Aroma: Malty Sweetness pours over your senses as you smell the kettle carmelization in this crafted brew. Light smokey and earthy tones rise up from this brew.

Apperance: The apperance was a dark copper color with moderate carbonation bubbles present. The head poured at very nice off-white and laced down the glass nicely.

Flavor: Hop flavor is low to none. This is the best brew that I have tasted in a long time. It goes down dangerously smooth with a carmelized grace matched with the roasted barley. I really cannot explain into words how great this Scottish Ale is!!! 

Mouthfeel: Low carbonation makes this a joy to set on your pallet. It is very creamy feeling. It is as if Scottish Highland angels gave you a scottish ale marshmellow to chew on...yummy.

Overall: Overall impression is that this is brew is crafted for all those that appreciate brew. Its sweetness mixed with roasty/toasty overtones and not a hint of hops makes this brew go down easy...dangerously easy. The only draw back is not knowing when to stop drinking this damn fine craftbeer.

I live about 25 miles away from the Pelican Pub & Brewery where this fine ale is brewed. This is the brew that started it all for me I must say. This is what made me a fan of cream ales.

Apperance: The appearance was a very light golden color. The carbonation was perfect adding several bubble trails shooting up to a very nice bleach white one finger head. Typical of cream ales this was a very light look. 

Smell: The smell was perfect. Not to bitter or strong. Just right. 

Taste: Now this is where this brew stood out for me. The taste was alive when you drank it. There was no lingering aftertaste and dare I say tasted as if the Beer Gods helped create this brew. 

Mouthfeel: If you could drink from a chalace in Vallhala, and take some of the drink back to earth...the mouthfeel would be less than this brew 

Drinkablility: This brew is the best Cream Ale on the West Coast I would be willing to bet. I have ordered many pints of this ale and have never been disappointed, ever. I would recommend this to anyone, including enemies. 

Sadly, the only drawback to this ale, if there is one, has nothing to do with the brew, but the distribution. The Pelican Pub & Brewery in Pacific City Oregon has pulled all distribution locations and only sells this crafted brew at their Pub and through mailorder. Good for me but not good for those wanting to pick up a bottle.
