Very dark brown to jet black with a medium brown head. Piney hope presence mixes with smoked malt character and bitter coffee on the finish that is not overpowering. Mouth feel is light like a regular IPA. Overall a very unique beer, as with most Mikkeller beers. Not sure I like the smokiness because it is reminiscent of a Rauchbier.
