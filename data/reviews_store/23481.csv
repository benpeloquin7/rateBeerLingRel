So when I saw this available, I happily paid the $15 for a 4-pack.  This was a major disappointment to me.  Not that its a terrible drink (and I say drink because this is much stronger than your normal microbrew beer), but because of the price and hype surrounding it.  The aroma is sweet like a good bourbon, the pour is as dark as old motor oil.  But the taste is overwelming.  The bourbon taste far overpowers all other ingredients.  I was able to pick up the coffee and vanilla in the aftertaste, but the initial is like a shot of whiskey.  This is definitely not a drinking beer, but a sipping beer.  This would be a great beer to enjoy on a cold night in front of a fire reading a good book.  Not so much if youre going to a frat kegger.  That 4-pack lasted me a week.

I just couldnt ignore the novelty of a chili beer.  Being a fan of spicy foods and good beer, this was a match made in heaven for me, right?  So I bought a 6 pack.  It took me 4 hours to drink one of these, and that was forcing myself to drink it while chasing it with a better beer.  I gave the other 5 to a friend, who probably poured them out after trying them.  Jeez, Id rather drink PBR than this crap. ",0.147,Fej,Arizona,4.7%,Cave Creek Chili Beer

But being that Im a beer snob too, the marriage of good bourbon and good stout is a beautiful thing.  And this one rates up there at the top.  Pours black, malty aroma, brown head, and a taste that combines the chocolatey richness of the stout with a slight sting of bourbon.  Perfectly crafted as to not overwelm the drinker with either.  Simply one of the best out there! ",89.261,Fej,Kentucky,8.5%,Bluegrass Jeffersons Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout
