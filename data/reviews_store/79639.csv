Extremely smooth and drinkable for its ABV.  More alcohol detected as the beer warms a bit.  Would definitely recommend for fans of barleywines and sweeter porters and stouts.

A touch more citrus or even a tiny bit more sour than your average amber beer.  

Aroma isnt very strong, but does smell good when you get close to it. A very smooth and flavorful amber, without quite as much as malty sweetness as others in the category. Not too sweet, not too bitter.  A fine balance. Highly recommended amber, and another fine ale from Ballast Point.  ",90.258,Stuntgibbon,California,5.5%,Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale
