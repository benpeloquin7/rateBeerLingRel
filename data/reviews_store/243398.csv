I hoped that would only pertain to the smell and not the taste, but unfortunately it tasted as bad as it its scent suggested.  This came from a mixed pack of Valkyrie beers, and I must say that the the brewery overall seems to still be a solid choice. The other beers Ive tried from it were rich and quite enjoyable, so Im hoping this was just a bad batch of Blaze Orange.  I normally try to salvage bad beers by making pancakes with them (especially with fruit or pumpkin beers), but  this one seemed beyond hope.  It was definitely a painful moment to have to pour the rest of a beer down the drain.  ",,HbBandit,Wisconsin,4.5%,Valkyrie Blaze Orange
