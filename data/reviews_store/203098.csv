Great beer. You never would think that it is 9.3%. Full of hop aroma and sweet malts. They have managed to keep the taste full and the abv up without having the overpowering alcohol aftertaste that you get from so many of these beers. Not served too cold here either so you can get a real feel for the overall taste. ,98.405,Bryn_Fowler,Colorado,9.3%,Odell Myrcenary Double India Pale Ale
