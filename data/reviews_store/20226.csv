This is my first report so please go easy on me. I have been drinking real beer for only a year or so.  We live in London but have a flat in Norfolk close to the Suffolk boarder. Anyway one of my favourite towns in the area is Southwold.  After years of think that real beer would be warm, have a dead taste and was what old men drink, I tried some and as they say have not looked back. Adnams is in many ways my local brewery and I have tried Adnams Bitter, Broadside, Explorer, Regatta, Fisherman, Oyster, the only products that I have been disappointed in are those in bottles i.e., SSB and the bottled Broadside. I think these are dreadful. This weekend I tried Flagship at the Sole Bay Inn, Southwold and this is what I thought. The beer is a dark gold or honey in colour. The taste is very shallow there is not a lot going on. The flavour is in my view metallic with a back ground which is like the bitterness of grapefruit. I only had one pint and I wish I had of taken note book so that I could describe this better. However my over all impression is that of a wimpy beer that anyone would be able to drink. There is no body to it and it is a bit of a disappointment. By the way I collect Adnams pump clips and wrote to them to see of they would sell me a Flagship one. They said no, their reason was that as flagship is not a seasonal beer or a regular they only made enough to cover the pubs that are going to sell it and once it gone this year that will be it. In my view that cannot come soon enough.
