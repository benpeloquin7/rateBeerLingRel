This is one brew that I always come back to.  This a classic American IPA with all that goes along with that.  Two hearted also happens to bitter and aroma their beer with one of my personal favorite hops Centennial.   The beer pours a perfect clear darker golden color.  The head is thick white and lacy that seems to linger on the glass as much as the aroma does.  The aroma is all hops, hops, and more fantastic hops.  The taste is definitely that signature centennial hops palate: earthy, spicy, and piney all in one.  TOP NOTCH!  ",99.788,hophead82,Michigan,7%,Bells Two Hearted Ale

This beer is a traditional English IPA with im guessing Fuggles and East Kent goldings as the bittering and aroma hops.  This beer pours a deep amber with a slight golden hue to it.  The taste is initially earthy, citrusy, and piney hops giving way to malt only to go right back down the rabbit hole to hops once again.  The aroma is easily grassy, earthy, and pine hops with a small amount of what appears to be crystal malt lingering in the background.  All around a fantastic version of a classic style.

This is how a bourbon barrel anything should taste.  The beer pours like an oil spill on a moonless night. This beer might just absorb light itself it is so dark and with very little head retention at all.  The smell is clearly bourbon barrel and roasted barley simply amazing!
