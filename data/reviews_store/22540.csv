Nice sweet molassis aroma.  Great colored head, like brown sugar, though not a whole lot of it:-(   Very smooth the whole way down.  Reminds me of having a good candy bar after not having one for a long time.  As thick at whole milk, and as dark as a 9 month overdue oil change on an 83 Delta88.  Pretty filling though.  Maybe a tiny bit on the sweet side, but with a salty snack thats a good thing.

Decent macro - clean - washes down whatever slop you are eating, but then so does water.
Certainly would not drink for the flavor, or any other characteristics.

Seriously though, this beer is Not Terrible, definately drinkable, but Not Even Close To Great.  Little sweet, somewhat coffe-like, and only to be consumed frigidly cold - see note.
