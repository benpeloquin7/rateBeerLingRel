The first few sips did not feel good. The taste was incredibly pine-aggressive. I did, however, muster though, and as the bottle became emptier and emptier, the more and more I enjoyed this beer. It is harsh at first, but it is very much worth drinking through and finding that sweet spot that truly defines a beer like this. Its great, but it isnt for cowards. 

If I had to compare it to an album, and I do, Id say this beer is very much like a mid-seventies Yoko Ono album. Once you sip past the screeching, you get a sense of the musicianship and vision, and its worth the initial shock to make it through to the finalized vision.

This beer pours perfectly and, once it warms just slightly, has a deep rich taste and feel. The smokiness couldnt be a better complement to the beer. 

I stumbled across this beer a couple years ago, when it appeared on tap at one of my favorite bars, and have been hooked ever since. Its an especially nice beer to spend most of an evening with, a very nice slow drinker. It just seems to get better and better as it continues to warm and breathe. It serves well as its own fireplace.

If this beer were an album, it would be Leonard Cohens Various Positions. His voice, at this point, is slightly raspy, but still incredibly soothing, and its an album that can be played over and over and over all through the evening. Its a perfect fit for a cool winters night. ",99.1,joedevivre,Alaska,6.5%,Alaskan Smoked Porter
