The best pils I ever tast. We visit the brewery and the days production was just bottle. The brewmaster gave a small tour and free tasting. Nice and friendly man with a lot of energi. He sure love what he was during. The beer has a fresh tast. Normal sparklig. Nice golden colour. Perfect for the hot greek weather. ,,larsalmar,Greece,5%,Piraiki Fresh Bio Beer Pils
