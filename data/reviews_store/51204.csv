Smells very nice-exactly what youd expect of an American Amber. Strong, but not off-putting, nice hops notes with a bit of maltiness and biscuit too. Looking forward to tasting this.

First sip goes down very well and picks up right where the smell takes off. Hoppy, citrusy, a bit malty, and with the bread/biscuit notes to back it all up. Very nice indeed.

Goes down smooth and balanced. Full of taste, but not heavy and feels good on the tongue/throat.

Smells really nice, textbook for what you would expect of this style. Wheat, yeast, and the banana and light spiciness (cardamom almost?) all combine together very well in a balanced mix.

Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.

Goes down easy with a light body, yet with plenty of flavor. Little carbonation and bubbles which is nice too.

Smells very nice. Floral with hops is the main note here-with some butter biscuit smells too.

Tastes alot like it smells with the hops the overwhelming note. A light malt backbone comes in too which is nice and then it finishes a bit dry. Some citrus notes join the floral aroma-but not too much.

This goes down pretty smooth for an APA and thats probably another reason it is so popular. Not heavy or light and leaves you wanting another.

For a light, in appearance, beer there is actually a few things going on here which is nice in the taste. The light citrus notes come first, then a bit of sweet hops, and then finished with a slight bitterness. Nice. Reminds me alot of some Czech pilseners too.

Tastes largely of hops, but not too strong and bitter. I feel like the 10% ABV can be detected near the end of each taste. The malt presence is stronger than I would have thought and the grapefruit notes are much stronger than in the smell.

Medium body mouthfeel overall. Smooth for all of the ABV and as much of a hopbomb that this is supposed to be.

Very slight tan head that stuck around for a bit and left some nice lacing. 

The smell is of malts, chocolate, and a general roasted flavor. Overall, quite nice to smell. 

The initial tastes are of roasts and some chocolate, and overall it is balanced well and fairly smooth. Not too full though and has some light sweet and nut hints. 

I dont know alot of other milk stout examples, but this is nice. Since it isnt too full, more of a medium to light bodied beer, you could drink a few of these in a session since theres plenty of flavorful and the ABV isnt fatal. I would recommend this to others to try and look forward to having another if I get the chance.  ",91.283,jspruit,North Carolina,5.7%,The Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout

Nice cloudy orange pour with a 1 finger head with some light carbonation-looks really nice. 

Light citrus aroma from the pour that smells clean and smooth with some floral notes and some spices. 

Spices and floral hints come through in the taste with some malts, light hops, and some yeast too. Pretty complex but well balanced overall. I can detect the alcohol a bit though I think. 

Goes down pretty smooth for something with all of these flavors, but I could do with a bit less carbonation. 

Id like to drink this one all day long as overall its very nice, but with an ABV this high I think that I can only have one (or two) in a session. Id definitely recommend this to others.

The color is a darkish brown/black with some ruby notes with a 1/2 finger head that is an off-white with some tan hints. 

The smell is a real mixture of spices-mostly Christmas type like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom-with some maltiness and a little floral and yeasty. The smell itself is very pleasant.

The taste is very nice with all of the spices mentioned above that are evident in the initial aroma. But there is alot more to this beer than spces as it there is some dryness and malty notes that are evident too. There is some slight nuttiness and some raisin hints too. At the end of each sip are some really nice notes that are more evident in porters and the maltiness becomes stronger-I really liked that too. 

The overall balance of all of these flavors is really quite impressive actually and I enjoyed the whole thing really as it feels great going down without too much carbonation.

There is a fair amount of sweetness so I cant drink too much of this one in one sitting, but Id like to because it is quite enjoyable. Ill definitely look for this one next year and recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting Christmas beer.

Poured a nice amber with some haze and an off-white head about 1.5 fingers high. Lacing settled to small rings around the glass as it went down and head disappeared after a bit.

Some grapefruit bitter hints in the smells, but mostly its just dominated by nice hops. Round aroma with just a bit of a bite-very nice. 

The hops hits you right away in the taste and is the dominant character going down although there is some slight maltiness and sweetness mixed in along with the light fruit notes. 

Overall it is a very light and tasty for an IPA this strong and it goes down much smoother than I would have imagined with this sort of ABV.

Nice bitter hops comes through as it hits your mouth upon tasting. Some floral hints and the citrus comes through too. 

Finishes in a nice bitter manner-dry and smooth and wanting more on your tongue. 

Nicely balanced for a double IPA and not too overpowering really. Id have another one of these for sure, but I think that Id only be able to have two or so in a session because of the ABV and also the effect of the hops on my tongue!

Not too overwhelming and has a nice body. The finish is nice and not too strong considering the 9% ABV. Unfortunately this isnt a session beer for me also because of the alcohol.
