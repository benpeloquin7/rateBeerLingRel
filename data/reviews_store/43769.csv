Dark amber color with a small head that lingered. Nothing interesting in the aroma.Smells like beer. Malt and hops with just a bit of fruit. Smells sweet. Almost no flavor on the front of the palate, with kind of a wheaty slightly orange flavor mid-palate, maybe a slight amount of brown sugar there too. The finish was all hops. Unimpressed, although, it had a  lingering flavor that was nice. ",22.831,bobthomas,Connecticut,,Southport Pequot IPA
