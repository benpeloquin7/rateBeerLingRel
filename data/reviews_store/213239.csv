It has a great aroma and not too much of an overbearing hoppy taste. The initial taste is sharp on the taste buds, which is nice since the hops arent over bearing. Afterwards the taste turns into a traditional hoppy taste, a little bit more strong than the initial first sip. After you swallow the hoppy after taste sticks and is pretty good. This IPA is a lot better than most of the IPAs I have tasted. Overall a good beer. Cheers. ",96.592,robroy89,Maryland,7.25%,Heavy Seas Loose Cannon Hop3
