Not so sure about whether I should dare drink a flavoured thing at first, but the waiters plea it would be served in a calabash made me take the adventure.

But from the first sip, there was an anstonishingly belgian taste...and really, the small print on the label said its made by Huyghe (known for Delirium Tremens). Not from the very heart of the black continent after all...

But never mind, if the idea of a sound belgian bruin with a harmonically integrated (not dominant) nut note does not scare you, give it a try...mandatoriliy from a calabash. ",22.956,schneidc,Belgium,7%,Mongozo Palmnut

the trick is to take it as it comes: a beer-like readily-avalable all-day refreshing beverage that you can take by litres and even in the midday beach sun without any serios hazard. brazilians take it exactly that way and thus it does its job. (hence my high  overall rating)

dont forget: an antarctica with a any drinking temperature above 1.5 celsius is altogether unacceptable ",0.883,schneidc,Brazil,4.9%,Antarctica Pilsen
