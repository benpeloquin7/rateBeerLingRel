I have not seen it around in years.  Believe it or not, the first time I had one was on Saipan, an island in the Mariana Island chain.  I have been looking for it ever since.  I was in Auckland and Sydney a few times and had no luck.  Needless to say I didnt find it in Samoa or Tonga either.  Too bad I live in the US now because there is even less chance that I will find it here.  Cheers, Craig of Saipan. ",2.94,CraigofSaipan,Australia,4.6%,KB Lager
