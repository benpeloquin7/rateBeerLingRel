Slight carbonation, but it subsided rather quickly. Fairly floral, hoppy aroma, but the flavor did not match. Flavor was spicy, with a hint of pine needle. Detected a bit of an alcohol flavor as well. Palate was dry, but not overwhelmingly so. Nice, strong hoppy beer. ",92.936,Rebelbeerguy,New York,8.4%,Southern Tier Big Red

Aroma had a slight doughy yeast note and a hint of orange spice. Very little hop evident.  As the beer warmed, the aroma intensified. Head was subtle, but more than sufficient and carbonation was constant.I sensed a slight sweetness, with a hint of spice. Palate: medium body, creamy, lively, long finish.
