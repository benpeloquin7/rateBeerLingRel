Nuclear hop bomb! Velvety texture in the mouthfeel up front, followed by a highly attenuated, thinner finish, allowing the hop zest, spice and citrus acidity to shine without too much malt interfering. The flavour brings out more of the tropical citrus aromatic qualities, along with some light maltiness that is not overly sweet, which tends to be a problem with many double IPAs out there. Bitter, resinous finish gives you the desired hop hop assault without astringency. The finish is not terribly long, but it is tasty and drying, making this a highly poundable brewski. Could possibly use more carbonation, but if you take the suggestion written on the top of the can, which is to ""DRINK FROM THE CAN!"", then its possible that it may not have needed more carbonation given that method of serving.

Flavour is wildly different than the nose suggests. Farmhouse funk, herbal, grassy hops and intense oaky Chardonnay notes dominate. The aftertaste is far less abrasive, leaving little hop impression and much more fruity and vanilla-oak impressions, with a bit of cream-like flavour and a strange suggestion of cinnamon. Lightly sweet, low bitterness and salty.  The mouthfeel features a highly attenuated, thin bodied, yet creamy texture with lively carbonation, and drying finish. The palate duration is long, leaving oaky and yeasty aromatics that linger. Still, this lovely brew coats tooth and gum while feeling dry in the finish. Alcohol is not so well-hidden, but complements the complex nuances this beer has to offer. Outstanding. I dont want this to end!

Like the finest raspberry dark chocolate truffles Ive ever had the pleasure of savoring. Fruity medium/light roasted coffee is also apparent in the aroma. The flavour has everything I hoped it would, which is everything present in the aroma. A long palate duration leaves a lingering of delicate roast and sweet raspberry/cocoa. The finish is really bone dry, which is not a characteristic I usually like paired with any sort of roasty, sweet beer. If dry is what they were going for, then they nailed it. Certainly thin-bodied, which is understandable at 4.6%, but still, a fuller palate would make this beer absolutely phenomenal. Maybe its not as thin-bodied as the finish is dry. Bone fuggin dry, yet there is still a nice lingering of the aforementioned flavours.  Some spruce-like hops tastefully counter the sweetness.

The nose has citric hops, mostly faint lemon and some pine, which in combination with the massive caramel malt impression, comes off smelling like tropical citrus fruits. Candy sweet caramel/cotton candy flavour with subdued hops, but still very nice citric notes coming through just enough to be considered an APA. In the finish and aftertaste a very unexpected vanilla and biscuit flavour emerges and lingers for sometime, later lending way to mixed citrus fruits again. I have no explanation for what that could be from, but Im into it! Syrupy mouthfeel almost puts this in the traditional ale category. This is seriously unexpected. As it warms, orange citrus, peach and kiwi flavours surface. This is a very complex, pleasing, malt bomb of an APA.  As Im much of a malt head as a hop head, this was no disappointment to me. Cali IPA drinkers will not like this, but who cares, theyre so one-dimensional with what they expect from their hoppy ales. Overall - of this I approve! fuck commerce!!!

The aroma is fresh, floral hops, butterscotch, doughy malts, and straightforward light maltiness. An earthier hop presence shines in the flavour along with nutty malt impressions (Munich malt, perhaps), a whisper of cocoa and a hint of old coffee. Straightforward beer style done right. Full-bodied for the style with gentle yet, tingly carbonation and a medium/long palate duration. This is proof that an organic ale can stand up to the rest of em. As this is a year-round beer, I must imagine that being organic, the spec on the malts will have slightly more variation in their specs, which might in turn mean the recipe must be tweaked with each brew to compensate, making it a bitch to brew (or not). I give Laurelwood tons of credit for helping lift doubts about beers produced from organic malts. I doubt the hops are organic, but if they are, even more kudos. Goes great with simple pub food and a go to session beer for me when living the dream of the 90s in Portlandia. This was my favorite amber and still may be. Rate to style, haters!

The aroma is a righteous bouquet of pine, resin, orange zest,  flowery hops and vinous, caramel-like malts. Im detecting slight oxidation, as there is a sherry component here, but this is certainly due to the cross-country shipping in the summer heat. Ive had it fresh at the brewpub and that certainly was not detectable there. It kinda feels like a mild barley wine, but Im not complaining, I dig it. The flavour is extremely bitter, citric and resinous with just the right amount of chewy, caramel-like malt character to back it up. The finish is a bit boozier that the abv might suggest, but its still incredibly drinkable for a 100 IBU destroyer of senses.

The flavour is not as pleasant as the nose is, as I like the aroma of these ingredients better than their accompanying flavours. The anise is so prominent, its bordering on offensive, but its named in the title of the brand so I guess I got what I signed up for. Impressions of vanilla, baking cocoa and oak round it out a bit. The aftertaste is the most pleasing part of this beer IMHO. The overall package is rather sophisticated for how extreme it is. Its not as abrasive as I had anticipated. The Belgian yeast is dominated by the roasted malt, anise and oak flavours, but I think thats a good thing. For such a mash-up, I find this to be relatively drinkable and enjoyable, as I find myself taking shorter and shorter pauses in between sips as it warms. I can taste the fusel alcohols, though, and I know its going to be a serious bitch getting to work at 7 tomorrow!
