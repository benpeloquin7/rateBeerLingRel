Again usually find myself drinking IPAs but lately as of circumstance have been indulging on the lighter end of the spectrum. Wouldnt have a problem putting back a couple of these bright clear Pilsners on another sunny afternoon in the near future. Nice to see the former Canoe Brew Pub brew master marching to the beat of his own drum. Nothing wrong with this beer. ,54.405,Dr_Schnitzel,Canada,5.5%,Hoyne Hoyner Pilsner

Very smooth bearing a nice straw head, this beer very much lived up to its definition as a classic ""Session Beer"". Never thought I would go back to an amber ale as my go to, but when push comes to shove this buck hit the spot. Kudos to Phillips Brewing for making a classic Ale that even an IPA drinker would take down again.    ",31.279,Dr_Schnitzel,Canada,5%,Phillips Blue Buck
