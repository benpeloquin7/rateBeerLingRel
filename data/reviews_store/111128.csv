I brought several cases of it home with me back to Arkansas. Its simply a really rich and flavorful beer that is not too heavy. It goes down perfectly while hot-tubbing in the snow. My only complaint is that you cant buy it outside of Wisconsin.  ,43.781,highlander733,Wisconsin,4.9%,New Glarus Spotted Cow

It is light and refreshing and full of flavor. My fridge is never without a six pack of this beer. My girlfriend doesnt like beer much (why I keep her around I dont know...ha!) but she LOVES this beer. Its the only beer she enjoys drinking. It has a subtle fruitiness to it that is very well balanced...in other words, it is not a fruit flavored beer per se, it simply has some soft fruity highlights.
