Very drinkable brew.  Quite delicious, and very fresh-tasting.  Hoppy, not too sweet, not too heavy.  The perfect beverage for warm days and cool nights.  Really just as good for breakfast as it is for dessert.   I think I drank the last glass in Chicago.  Bring back this amazing brew! ",,moStar,Illinois,5.5%,Rock Bottom Chicago Dirty Blonde Ale
