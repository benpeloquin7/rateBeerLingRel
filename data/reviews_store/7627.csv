Pours with a huge head that is fed for a good while by the (excessive?) carbonation.  Deep red body that is quite opaque.   The carbonation almost overpowers the initial taste of rich malt and green apple but as it moderates the taste really comes through.  Good pour if a bit too sweet for my taste. ,95.905,spynavyes3,Belgium,7.5%,Corsendonk Pater / Abbey Brown Ale
