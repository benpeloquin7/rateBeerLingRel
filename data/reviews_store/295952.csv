Taste coffee and dark chocolate, dry finish. Decent RIS, love the base beer. Lost a little body after barrel aging. DutchSky is a weird whisky, and leaves a weird impression.

Drunk at room temperature, which I can highly recommend for this type of beer. Dark brown colour with quickly dissipating off white head. Low carbonation. Subtly sweet with dried fruits and yeast in the nose, caramel and hops present as well. Alcohol nicely balanced, but present. A good beer, but definitely not the best, perhaps even overhyped.
