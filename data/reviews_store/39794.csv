With such a long name and the promise of bourbon barrell aging I was enchanted into picking one of these guy up at the locale store.  Its fairly dark with very little head - theres a lot of stouty stuff going on (slight roast, a bit of coffee and maybe a hint of chocolate) with a bit of bourbon taste floating around.  Mouth feel was incredibly thin and I agree with a previous reviewer - this is probably a really strong sweet stout masquerading as an Imperial.  Interesting but I probably wont get another.
