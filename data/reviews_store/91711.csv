Genuinely amber in the glass with no head retention. Pear, apricot, boiled sweets, husky grain notes, straw. No hop flavors per se but a fairly bitter finish. Fairly flat, watery in the mouth. I like most of the Burleigh beers but this one rubs me up the wrong way. Hardly an IPA.  ",86.615,Parrotshake,Australia,7%,Burleigh FIGJAM IPA
