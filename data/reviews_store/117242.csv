I was skeptical at first because the label mentioned the use of black patent malt, I figured, what the hell and bought it anyway.  The beer pours midnight black with plenty of carbonation.  The aroma is of faint roasted malt, no hops.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily and as I suspected the black patent malt drowns out most of the other ingredients.  Basically it shouldnt be called a black IPA.  Its more like a stout with too much hops.  I expected better after tasting the organic IPA last week.

Pours black with an ample beige head.  Aroma is sweet, with hints of toasted malts and a coppery flavor.  A bit overly fizzy for a stout, also the mouthfeel is a little thin.
