A blended cider packaged for old style effect.  It fools no-one. One reviewer suggested it lacks character.  I would go further and suggest that it gives mass produced and well circulated ciders a clear field.. Ive taste own brand supermarket ciders better than this.

Most of all its all about Apples! Apples! and yes.. more Apples!  Sparlkling semi-sweet with a slightly dry finish.  Although strangely named it seems after a Steam Traction Engine... its is apt if only to add sensory depth to that classic novel ""Cider with Rosie"".   If you read the book.. this is the Cider featured center stage.  A gem. Best served chilled on a summers day in a corn field with a good friend. Maybe just one or two though as its rather strong!
