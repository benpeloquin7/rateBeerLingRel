Fate conspired one day to bring this sacred beer to me...and, lo, I did keep it at a cool temperature until special occasions dictated a special beer. 

Although, it should be noted. This beer is its own special occasion.

Beautiful but thin white head with some lacing on the glass. Smell was heavenly. Full-tasting and complex. 

I think, to be honest, I liked the Rochefort 10 over this one. But this is excellent. 

It is also very strong. My ears are flushed and radiating heat. Droplets of sweat are on my bald head..but, oh, this is divine.  ",,riordan93,Belgium,10.2%,Westvleteren 12 (XII)
