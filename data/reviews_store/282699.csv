It has a dark, golden colour and produces a proud amount of white, foamy head. You can detect a hint of pine and a strong citrus flavour. Great carbonation and pleasant floral aroma to balance it out.

All in all, very impressed with this brew! I would give it an 8/10 rating and if you happen to be visiting Eastern Canada, I seriously recommend a visit to the PEI Brewing Company, which produces this amazing product. ",,the_boozehound,Canada,6.5%,Gahan 1772 IPA
