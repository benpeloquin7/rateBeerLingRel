Nothing very remarkable about this beer.  Mellow peat aroma.  Fairly carbonated.  Tastes from start to finish like earth and babyfood vegetables.  Not skunky, but not very toasty either.

Id had it in bottles before, but this was far superior.  Looks and smells just like it tastes.  Light will not penetrate the glass.  Coffee, dark chocolate and sorghum beets(?).  It hit that fine line of light carbonation that I crave in a porter.  Served cool, it  morphed nicely over 20-25 minutes. Lace hung on the glass throughout.  Bringing the smoke down a little bit might make it perfect. ",98.513,breadbones,New Hampshire,6.2%,Smuttynose Robust Porter

Smells pleasant, not at all overpowering.  Looks like peach iced tea.  Definitely near the top in taste for such a strong ale.  Yeasty but not alc-y.  Pine and bitters keep it from being fruity at all, to me.  Lingers a bit like stale bread though.  Awesome brew but tastes more like a Mondale in my opinion!
