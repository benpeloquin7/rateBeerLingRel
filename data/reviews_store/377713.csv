Bitter orange was overpowering and almost a fake flavoring. I could not pick up any of the phenolic notes from the Belgian yeast due to the overpowering bitter orange. I love Belgian whites, and I must say the 1st I have ever pored down the drain after half a glass. The bitter orange taste stayed in my mouth for an hour after. Does not compare to Blue moon or any other craft Belgian white I have brewed or tasted. Very disappointed.  ",42.803,cessnapix,Massachusetts,4.8%,Harpoon UFO White
