It pours dark walnut brown with little  off white head and lots of haze.  The aroma is strongly of rasisin and figs, and as it warms lots of oaky coconut/vanilla aromas are present.  The first sip hits hard with strong alcohol, which quickly fades to strong notes of bourbon and figs, chocolate covered rasins with pralines. The second sip yields some maple syrup and cherries. The body is thick, rich and heavy.  The chocolate increases significantly as it warms up.  

All in all this beer is well worth the initial sticker shock, for layers upon layers of flavor for sure, it doesnt look very good at first pour but it makes up for it and then some.  ",99.683,edecambra,California,16.2%,The Bruery Cuivre

The taste is more tart than the armoa and spices come through strong, but not out of balance.  Soft ""wonderbread"" doughy malt in background, but present.
