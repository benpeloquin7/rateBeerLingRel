Glowing reddish brown.  Crystal clear.  Beautiful pillowy head.  Aroma is malt and herbal hops.  Taste includes sherry, molasses, herbal hops.  Palate is balanced, maybe a tad on the malt side.  Little hop presence.  Head remained thick halfway down the glass with great lacing throughout. ",33.095,wile,Arizona,5.8%,Barrio Scottish Red
