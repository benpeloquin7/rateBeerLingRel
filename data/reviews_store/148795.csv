Smells crisp and fresh with just a tinge of alcohol content present. Smells better as the glass empties.

Appearance - Clear and golden with a nice 1 finger head that persist throughout the majority of the session. Light in color to match the summery flavor.

Taste - A medium amount of bitterness for a blond ale, but absolutely welcome. The hoppy scent is aided by the hoppy finish that lingers. Bitterness leaves a fresh taste that persists, but not too hoppy to resist throwing back a few. Tastes floral with a sweet caramel malt in the background. No off flavors I can recognize.

Palate - Light and playful on the palate. Bitter finish that lasts, but isnt unpleasant. Light body, overall lighter beer with the perfect amount of carbonation and flavor for a summer day.

Overall - Great beer that fits in well with hoppier golden ales. Akin to Victory Prima Pils in the bitter light ale sense, but clearly a different family of hops. Will be drinking this again. ",83.967,MikeEnIke,Pennsylvania,5.2%,Victory Summer Love

Clear with a nice frothy head. Lighter head on the beer, immediately clings to the glass and persists.Aroma - Smell immediately fills your nose with sweet flowery notes. Has the nose of an IPA with big citrus and floral American hops. The nose lingers, to the point I thought I had some still on my upper lip. Really great smell.Taste - Mouth instantly coated with strong bittering hops. Nothing unappealing, but clearly a hoppy beer; however, unlike an IPA, there is some clear focus on the malt with this brew. A nice dark malt has enough sweetness to balance some of the bitter and give it a light roasty flavor. Smell and Taste work hand in hand on this brew to make a great final product. Hop heavy, but malt wasn?t ignored. Alcohol burn is present, especially in the after taste, but not necessarily a negative. Citrus/grapfruit flavor really comes in after a few sips. Delicious hop blend. Mouthfeel - Feels slightly heavy initially, but quickly lightens up with the carbonation. Balanced nicely with the carbonation, not a meal in the glass, but not ""refreshing"". Good mouthfeel.Overall - Not the perfect beer, but delicious. Clearly similar roots to Arrogant Bastard, will have to look up comments on the two. Strong alcohol, but not overbearing alcohol flavor. Hoppy up front with a nice malty sweet balance on the backend. The bomber won?t be going to waste, that?s for sure. ",98.78,MikeEnIke,California,8.5%,Stone Lukcy Basartd Ale (Lucky Bastard)

No hint of light shines through. A dark brown head slowly bubbles to the top before it dissipates to a small covering. Then persists ever so slightly throughout consumption.Smell: 5/5Immediate blast of dark, roasted chocolate. Smells like winter time with a nice dark chocolate candy bar. Roasted, slight hints of coffee, major chocolate notes. Little to no boozy smell, really a great smell. Wish they sold yankee candles with this smell. Just a hint of citrus bring some great balance. Hard to pick up, but slowly builds.Taste: 5/5Doesn?t disappoint. Again, major roasty chocolate flavor, slight undertone of roasted coffee but doesn?t pack a major coffee flavor until the very second you think the flavor has dissipated from your mouth, then the coffee hits you all at once. It?s fantastic. Dark roasted malt coats your mouth, with a slight sweetness, balanced well by the bitter. A big stout, puts hair on your chest. The coffee breath when it fades is great.Mouthfeel: 5/5Carbonation dances on your tongue despite the expectation of weight. Coats your mouth with bitter at first, which open you to the full body flavor. Quickly washes away, to give you a lingering tingle. Bold, not too heavy.Overall: 4.8/5One of the best Imperial Stouts I?ve had. Great balance, not too boozy nor too light. Imperial chocolate with hints of coffee, a great roast, but not so big you can only drink one. ",99.259,MikeEnIke,California,10.2%,Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout
