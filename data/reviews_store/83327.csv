It poured without much head but the aroma was appealing, smoky fruit with soft yeast. The taste showed a thin front of fruit and spice that faded into a rich flavor of smoked fish. The fruit flavors soon collapse to alcohol but its quite drinkable with food. I would only get this again if I craved a lox flavored beer.
