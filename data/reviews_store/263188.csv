The aroma was lively with the blood orange really coming through and a subtle smell of pepper. It really piqued my interest. The taste didnt disappoint. The blood orange was just as strong as it was in the nose and the peppercorn gave it just the right kick. Really a unique beer that Ive got to have again!
