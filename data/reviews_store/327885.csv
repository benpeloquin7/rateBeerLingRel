Poured out of a bomber purchased at local beverage store. Has a medium head that sticks round along with a bready, coffee aroma and reddish - brown color (cherry cola was my favorite deScription when reading other reviews). Actually, color may be its strongest attribute. Maudie seemed to be more bubbly than other Unibroues that Ive sampled, save, Ephemere. It has a full body and the spices give it a long finish. The first taste I had of Maudite was amazing with a balance of bitter and sweet. I thought that this beer was as good as the reviews that I had read some time ago. 

And then the spices kicked in....Im not going to even to try to describe what they are. What Ill write is that my first glass started out great, was tougher in the middle, and then finished well (maybe it was due to the 8% alcohol content). I had my second glass two nights later after storing the rest in a small Sodastream bottle. That one seemed to drink better all the way through as I was expecting the spice. I know those folks up in Quebec (who have shown that there is more to Canadian beer than Molson and Labatts) like to brew in the Belgian style, which may include a lot of spices. I know Stella Artois doesnt use them - at least, to excess. May need to do some research... ",98.136,jnortonvt,Canada,8%,Unibroue Maudite

The only down side of this brew is the price as its twice the price as the lowest price selection at the Growler Garage in S. Burlington, VT. Maybe my nose is stuffy but Im not catching much of an aroma. Maybe its because Im drinking out of a pint glass with it half-empty/half-full..

Anyway, it is a cloudy, reddish beer with a lively carbonation and a surprisingly abrupt finish. One can surely taste the strawberries, which cuts the bitterness but not too much.

Wow! This is light years ahead of the Molsons and Labatts that I drank in the 80s and early 90s before the microbrewery movement in the US put us ahead of our pals to the north, in my opinion. But enough history...to the Beer!

A large cloudy glass of golden beer with a small, frothy head was brought to the table as I was waiting for my Poutine topped with Smoked Meat (again when in Rome). There was a fruity aroma - definitely orange - with a similar taste. Gotta say that it was one of the better beers Ive had in a while and appreciated the long finish. My wife, who is not a beer drinker, was very impressed! 

Best beer Ive ever had? Not that sure. Yet, this certainly convinced me that our Canadian friends realized loud and clear that American (micro)brewers moved American beer ahead of theirs and Unibroue has been fighting back hard for their countrys honor. Ill be looking for this at my favorite beer places along with local and brews that Ive never tried. Hope to go back to Montreal soon and will purchase some to bring back over the border if need be.
