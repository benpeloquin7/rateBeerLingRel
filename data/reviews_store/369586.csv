Damn so much hate on here. No, it is not a traditional tasting geuze. The sourness and funk are super mild but theyre undoubtedly there. Id place this more in the belgian christmas beer wheel house and the lightness of the geuze qualities add a really delightful complexity to the brew. In fact, Id say this is one of my favorite christmas beers of the year. Definitely malt forward, even a little sweet and raisiny. Very solid beer and something Ill definitely buy again ",10.621,concordiam,Belgium,5.6%,Chapeau Xmas Gueuze
