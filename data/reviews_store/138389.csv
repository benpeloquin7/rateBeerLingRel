This is probably one of the most terrible non-tasting beers ive ever tasted. And believe you me. Ive tasted a lot of beers during my years. If you ever stumble over this beer - let it alone. Ive just thrown  almost a whole bottle down the drain. I wouldnt even drink this beer if I was given it freely. ,1.03,bigfootsif,Slovenia,4%,Viktor Pilsener Export
