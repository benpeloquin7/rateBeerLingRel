This brew is a West Coast styled IPA and has quickly become one of my favorite IPAs.  It has a really nice balance between the hops, which are definitely present...for those hopheads, and the malt backbone.  My recommendation to all is: when you see this at your favorite Watering Hole don&apos;t hesitate to give it a try; you won&apos;t be disappointed!

This is not a beer for those that do not enjoy a hoppy beer, which I happened to be just a few months ago.  Now I enjoy the ""Hoppier the Better"" brews and this definitely fits the bill!
