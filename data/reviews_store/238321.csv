Thick and black with small brown head. Not much lacing. Smells great - very different with the expected toffee and bitter chocolate overpowered by the anise and licorice. The combo almost comes across like banana bread?  Tastes like it smells with the licorice upfront and a nice bitter toffee cocoa finish. I like this. I&apos;m keeping one in the cellar. I think this will taste great with a little age and mellowing of the licorice.

Takes away from the over all enjoyment of this beer.
 Think I will stir it up and let it sit a bit.
