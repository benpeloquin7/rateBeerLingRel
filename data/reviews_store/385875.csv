I must have been under the influence... The second time I purchased it, clarity took over my mind and my palate: this beer really sucks! I drank about half the bottle in hopes the taste would improve, then abruptly stopped, frightened for my life! Could it be poisoned? Or was it just a bad batch? Did mice fall in the barrels and couldnt get out, or did they just pull down their mice pants and pee in them? Or maybe, as my husband kept repeating to me, it just sucked! Sour, bitter, nasty, evil, fizzy stuff! Yes, it will get you inebriated, but is it really worth it? My recommendation: dump the rest of the bottle down our clogged drain (it should be clear by morning) and search your house for some whiskey -- any brand will do!
