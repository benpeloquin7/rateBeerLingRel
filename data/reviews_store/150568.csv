CHOCOLATE. The aroma is of chocolate topping. The front palate is dominated by the cholocate smell and a nice up front bittering. The taste quickly becomes choc/vanilla and continues with the bite, like 70% chocolate. The finish is a lingering roasty choc flavour. This beer is a great desert stout!
