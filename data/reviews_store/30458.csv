Curious about this beer I ordered a half pour to kick off the evening. The cider and hops play nicely with each other in a way that I would not have predicted. Thinking outside the box definitely paid off with this release. Hopefully #37 and beyond are just as playful.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent golden base sits exposed to the air with no head to speak of. Lemon crisp, sweet bitter hops, and tart cider sparkle.

Flavor / Palate - Lemon, honey, and almonds emerge after sip two. The sweet finish glows with citrusy hops. Whatever category you try to pigeonhole this beer it will be a unique twist. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,,BottleHouse #36 (Hopped Cyser)

Before heading out I grabbed one last pour from Royal Docks to mark the end of a nice afternoon. Typical of the other sample it has a local feel; not the greatest but done competently enough to be enjoyable. If Royal Docks was my local Id have no problems stopping by for a few pints.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel bronze body crawls up and down the sides of the tasting glass. Thin wispy curls of head move freely. The nose smells like an English style IPA - malty and clean with little fuss.

Flavor / Palate - Smooth malts open up over the course of a few sips. The smooth oaky texture opens up into a calm bitter finish. Nothing stands out but as a benchmark for an American version of the style there are plenty of worse examples. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,6.3%,Royal Docks Tanglefoot IPA

Life has made it difficult to make regular trips to Willoughby but beers like this remind me of why I should do so. They dont always come through with the cream of the crop but most are reliable daily drinkers. This falls into the second category. A big winter warmer defies easy categorization.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel bronze body glimmers with warmth. The thin ivory head settles to almost nothing after a few seconds. Sweet malts, wheat crackers, and other flavors hang in the air above the glass like a fog.

Flavor / Palate - Chewy waves of flavor crawl across the tongue and throat. A sweet burn of malty wheat dances in waves of alcohol. Boozy apple sauce winds down a respectable release. I dont know that it would be a go to beer but for a one off it falls in line with other Willoughby releases. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,7.2%,Willoughby Snowbird

Finishing out the festival by making the round one last time I stopped by Moerleins booth to see what they hauled up to Cleveland. Among the drafts was a big beer that was possibly the highlight of the festival. If time had permitted I would have loved to try a few more pours.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep chestnut base soaks up the warm light as the icy legs crawl downwards. Brandy, apples, malt, and dense sticky highlights of fresh cider float upwards with ease.

Flavor / Palate - Apples, pear, and other sweet fruits blossom on the tongue. The transition explodes with warmth as the full brunt of the 11% ABV hits the senses. The smooth mellow finish takes off the edge as it caps a well executed barrel treatment. Hopefully this gets a bit more buzz from the locals before it goes away.

I really had no idea what to expect when asking for a pour of this. As it turns out the resulting beer tastes like someone liquefied a Cinnabon snack. Four ounces was just enough to get a feel for a sticky sweet beer that I dont think I would be eager to try again.

Aroma / Appearance - A semisweet sticky nose hangs in the air with the texture of thick glazing, cherries, and a little splash of Red Vines for good measure.

Flavor / Palate - Apple strudel, malt, and cherry brighten the tongue. Sweeping into a sticky finish, the results are different.

I should have expected nothing better but optimistically gave it a try anyways. Goodwood Brewing might be a spinoff from BBC but they still have not impressed me enough to consider them worth pursuing too actively.

Aroma / Appearance - Golden yellow liquid filters downwards with a generic appearance that you might see in a beer commercial. Cereal grain, toasted bread, and stale lemons do little to excite the senses.

Flavor / Palate - Grains soaked in lemon butter flow freely across the palate. Fast fading bursts of generic alternatives to Sprite leave with a whimper.

Looking through the selection of New Years Eve beers I opted to try this one based on the name. The results didnt quite live up to the label. Even so there might be worse brown ales. I am at least willing to give Moab Brewing another chance down the road.

Aroma / Appearance - An ivory head graces a calm rusty brown hued foundation. Tea and malt tickle the air with a light sweetness that is unremarkable.

Flavor / Palate - Carbonated iced tea splashes across the tongue before fading into a faint memory. The simplicity does not spark much excitement.

Wandering past Vintages booth lured me into sampling this gem. The results delivered from start to finish. I hope I can make it back to Vintage before the next year to see what they are up to. Theyve definitely added something to the local scene.

Aroma / Appearance - A murky chestnut base bobs up and down. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and a warm booziness merge into a sticky feel that betrays the barrel treatment.

Flavor / Palate - Spicy pumpkin, whipped cream, and a shot of mid tier bourbon warms the palate after just a few sips. Squash rounds out a profile that tastes like a specialty drink from Starbucks.

Thanks to a generous trader for sending this a while ago. The last vestiges of winter felt like the right time to crack it open. Ill have to get the bourbon barrel release next so I can see how it compares. This middle of the pack strong ale demonstrates why not all breweries are created equal.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep velvet black pour flows downwards like melted chocolate. Sandy head filters the scents of melted bakers chocolate, malt, and semisweet cookies.

Flavor / Palate - The chewy mouthfeel of Hersheys kisses, black coffee, and dried figs warms the palate. A full bodied finish bursts into a soft bitterness.

Lurking in the back of the fridge, this beer came out during a time when winter decided to make its last stand. Taking the seasonal in a different direction, it manages to impress. It makes me remember why I should revisit Boulevard more often.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent mandarin orange body glows as it illuminates the surrounding area. Slight tartness mingles with nutmeg and cinnamon. A dry feel permeates the presence which overall falls in the middle of the pack.

Flavor / Palate - Pumpkin pie splashed with a few drops of vinegar bites at the tongue and throat. An easy drinker impresses with the ease at which it goes down.

In typical Great Lakes fashion this sweet stout provides flashes of brilliance amid streaks of the mundane. For a daily drinker there are worse options. That said I think I will stick to other locals for my stout fix.

Aroma / Appearance - A sandy head melts into the black base. Cool oatmeal cookies sprinkled with sugar and malt offer a thin veneer of interest that fades in a minute or two.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy burnt oatmeal tickles the palate. A dry delayed bitterness provides a tease before things fade into a distant memory.

Phoenix Brewing shows enough potential that I may make the trek to Mansfield some time to sample the rest of their lineup. The clever names alone would make it worthwhile.

Aroma / Appearance - A black fluid base bobs below a mocha head. Spicy chocolate, malt, and chai smell like a funky shot of hot chocolate.

Flavor / Palate - Malt, coffee, and then a burst of spices compose the bulk of the body. The middling baltic porter manages to be well done without any major flaws. Other than perhaps a bit more body the results pass muster for a regional brewery. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,9%,Phoenix Mary Jane

Tucked away in one of the corners of the Winter Warmer festival was Cornerstones booth. Doing a second lap I decided to give this a shot. While not a great imperial stout the results are satisfying enough that Id order a pour at either location.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base tinged with a mocha head easily fits the part of a typical American imperial stout. Chocolate volcano cake, orange glaze, and light coffee highlight a rich experience that does fade rather briefly.

Flavor / Palate - A fluid body floats across the palate with a texture that is a trace light for the style.

The final pour from Lucky owl showed off a different side of their approach to brewing. Take a bit of a traditional saison and mix with it a Cleveland winter to get a feel for this solid release.

Aroma / Appearance - A golden transparent body glimmers with a cloudy core. Drought stricken farmland splashed with laundry softener lazily wafts upwards. The general impression leaves behind a balanced and smooth feel.

Flavor / Palate - Earthy and dry, the first impression piques the curiosity. A balanced approachable version of a saison lacks any major features to set it apart; this also means it lacks any glaring problems. Id drink it again if it appeared on tap at a local bar.

The second to last sample from Lucky Owl represents a typical American style pale ale. Full of in your face hops and texture, it could make a great daily drinker if you just wanted to focus on a single brewery. If you want to get a sense of Lucky Owls approach to brewing it makes a good foundation.

Aroma / Appearance - A cool soft presence carries with it musty hops that hang in the air.

With the local market pretty slim pickings it would not take much to be the best brewery in Geauga County. Even so Lucky Owl manages to set itself apart. Hopefully their success allows them to grow a bit more under their own terms and eventually sell beyond just Chucks Fine Wine. In the meantime grab one or two bombers when you visit.

Aroma / Appearance - A light golden presence glows with life as it brightens the passing light. Fresh soft head carries with it the scent of sweet banana esters and open yeast.

Flavor / Palate - Ripe bananas, freshly folded laundry, and mild maltiness soothe the palate. The clean sessionable finish leaves traces behind without being bland.

A clever name and eye catching packaging pulled this seasonal into my cart during a visit to the Cincinnati area. It managed to impress with little reason to waste even a drop. One again MadTree affirms a risk by providing great rewards.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep mahogany body presents itself like a caramel brownie decorated by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Nutmeg, spiced pumpkin pie, and cinnamon drive the agenda with little bready notes to steer it to the other end of the spectrum.

Flavor / Palate - Pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg lighten the mood. An assertive transition and finish glow with warmth as the 8% ABV makes itself known.

If you are heavily into rye IPAs then this beer could be up your alley. To me it goes all in on the wrong things and falls short in most of them. It wont keep me away from Lazy Magnolia in the future yet I have slightly lower expectations going forwards.

Aroma / Appearance - The semitransparent amber body settles below soft white snowy head. Rye, mulched leafs, and a slightly harsh bitterness push things too hard too quickly to be enjoyable.

There are plenty of great breweries in Virginia. After trying this pale ale Im not sure if Lickinghole is one of them. It doesnt have any major flaws but neither is it anything special either. If you need a benchmark then it makes as good a comparison as anything else.

Aroma / Appearance - The transparent bronze body glimmers under a fresh vanilla head. White wine, gentle hops, and soft cool malts enrich the air. The inviting nature does enough to garner respect but not much more.

Flavor / Palate - The bitterness of cotton candy soaked in tree sap bites at the mouth and tongue. Vinous flavors emerge seconds later. The finish then fades quickly and unremarkably.

The name caught my eye in the program but the chance to test a new brewery sealed the deal. If I ever get a chance to visit while passing through Columbus it will be on the agenda. In the meantime maybe a few bottles will make their way northwards.

Looking this beer up while standing nearby I could not believe I had not tried it before. A fine example of a berliner weiss doesnt appeal to tricks to deliver a pleasing experience. If this ever gets into regular rotation as a seasonal I could see it doing well to audiences tired of the average IPA or stout.

Aroma / Appearance - A golden body and thin head fill the glass with carefree ease. Tart wheat and citrus cut through a foundation of sourness which balances on the knifes edge between dull and too acidic.

Flavor / Palate - Light and tart textures fill the mouth with a refreshing feel. Citrus and vinegar carry the waves of liquid from start to finish.

A nice IPA doesnt quite live up to regular Head Hunter. Even so its tropical aspects brighten the mood of a dreary northeastern Ohio winter afternoon. As long as Fat Heads keeps up this level of quality they will have no problems keeping a high profile.

Based on past experiences with Weyerbacher I approached this with caution. Fortunately the low cost made it an easy purchase. Next year I might not overthink things so much; this does a great job of being what it should and nothing more.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent bubbly body looks like watered down pumpkin. Crisp minimal head helps buffer the vinegar and peaches that cut through the air like a knife. It is a tad too strong for a typical Berliner Weiss but not full on abrasive.

Flavor / Palate - Bubbly champagne cools the tongue and throat. A peachy Riesling slowly turning to vinegar sticks in the memory. The sharp bite keeps it from being completely world class although if treating this as an American style sour you could overlook that flaw.

Wandering past Cornerstone, tucked away in a corner, I decided to give this little oddity a shot. Mostly unremarkable it tries hard to be more than it is. Next time Ill stick to the beaten path when sampling their releases.

Aroma / Appearance - A semitransparent raspberry core rests below a white head with blackberry and pie filling.

Flavor / Palate - Blackberry and raspberry filling tickle the throat. A light sweet texture sticks around briefly. Sadly it then disappears with little fanfare.

A decent wit beer provides everything that you should expect from a local brewery. I dont think I will be going out of my way to head to Westlake but if I am passing through with time to kill might give them a chance.

Aroma / Appearance - The scent of lemons and starchy laundry rise upwards from a glimmering transparent body.

Trying another new brewery I chose to go with a different style. This porter manages to hit the mark but it doesnt create a good first impression. Im wiling to give Canton Brewing a second look however to see if they bring anything new to the local scene.

Aroma / Appearance - A black fluid base sits below ivory head. Iced coffee provides the only scents of note.

Flavor / Palate - Basic coffee picked up at the donut shop or gas station warms the palate. The lack of depth does make it forgettable after only a few sips.

A run of the mill old ale kicked off a local beer festival with style. Big, bold, and full of flavor it shows plenty of promise from a brewery I couldnt have even told you existed a month ago. Hopefully they manage to stick around and improve even more.

Aroma / Appearance - The sticky thick body coats the glass edges. A soft head adds some nice presence to a balanced and calm appearance.

Flavor / Palate - The warmth oozes over the tongue within a few seconds. The slight booziness requires patience; this isnt a beer to rush through.

For the cost (about $1.69) this was simply too interesting to pass up on a run to the local store. The results dont disappoint. If you expect something amazing look elsewhere but it definitely offers fair bang for the buck.

Aroma / Appearance - Roasted chestnut liquid flows around the glass with ease. Ivory head melts like marshmallows over an open flame. Pumpkin bread, nutmeg, and cooling tea blend into a semisweet cool feel of late fall.

Flavor / Palate - Fresh chai crests on a wave of bubbly whipped cream. Squash and chocolate chips refresh the palate. From start to finish the experience remains well balanced.

Theres little to be said about Portside other than they are not in the upper tier of Cleveland area breweries. Save your money for the latest offerings from almost anyone else.

Aroma / Appearance - A super dense head surges to the top of the glass. Only after a few minutes does it settle down to manageable levels of chocolately brown liquid. Chocolate, steeped iced tea, and black coffee feels astringent and tart as if something is off.

Flavor / Palate - Tart bubbly chocolate indicates something is amiss from the get go. Chocolate pudding, burnt coffee, and toast melt away with a mercifully short flavor profile.

A little off kilter, this beer somehow manages to carve out a strange niche. It wouldnt be my first option but during Happy Hour the options could be worse. Once youve exhausted the better drafts then give it a whirl.

Aroma / Appearance - A chocolately brown base hides below icy legs. Bananas soaked in alcohol blast the nose with chocolate liquer. Thick and runny as if you poured in a splash of Hersheys kisses, it melts away slowly.

A fine baltic porter brings to mind Three Floyds greatest hits. Rather than blasting you with hops it uses a different approach that almost encouraged me to buy a bomber a few days later. Give this one a try to rekindle your passion for a great style.

Aroma / Appearance - Maple brown body looks like liquid bacon swirling around the shaker. Vanilla head melts away in time. Semisweet chocolate chips and mellow malts waft upwards with a calm laid back feel.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate bars, smores, and malt emerge after a delay of a few seconds.

While nothing short of excellent this version pales in comparison to the original. Something about the way that it amps up the coffee profile to an extreme unbalances the results just a little. Id still drink it if offered but it just goes to show that quantity does not always mean quality.

Aroma / Appearance - A long boozy sheet of ice slides downwards in the same oily black core that is present in all Speedway variants. Black coffee, a splash of creamer, and little else densely hang in the air like a thick morning fog.

Flavor / Palate - Coffee, creamer, and hazel warm the throat. The sweetness that carries into a malty finish makes it different than your average version.

Learning about a keg being tapped in the area I made weekend plans immediately. The drive was worth it - this takes regular Speedway Stout to an entirely new level. It would be great to try a few more varieties in the future as they trickle eastwards.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep oily black core rests heavily below snaky legs. Light tropical notes are unexpected above the typical coffee, malt, and chocolate of the world class base.

Flavor / Palate - Dark chocolate, raspberries, and mango warm the throat. Next comes candy bars, pineapple, and Laffy Taffy. The overall impression feels like drinking a beach resort on Maui.

A nice saison tries to be something unusual. Whatever its intent it brings a new twist to the pumpkin seasonal. Sadly the results do not work harmoniously. You could do worse but there are hundreds of better Against the Grain options.

Aroma / Appearance - A creamy caramel body glimmers with life. The smell of herbal tea polishes the air but along for the ride is a distracting medicinal note. Otherwise the bright earthiness rises with ease.

A little bit of a letdown, this average vienna did not spark any excitement at all. Fortunately the rest of the flight made up for it. If youre looking for six beers to fill a sampler then dont worry about this session beer.

Aroma / Appearance - A light maple colored body supports a thin delicate head. Crisp clean malt dominate a profile that is semisweet in nature.

A well meaning and clever release has its legs taken out from under it halfway through the sample. While the cherry wood creates a different twist on a smoked beer it doesnt make me want to relive the experience over other previous Against the Grain smoked drafts.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze semitransparent base glimmers with light. Light smoke feels faint in contrast to what it could have been. Paired with the sweet cherry undertones it almost pulls off the upset.

A pedestrian release (at least for Against the Grain) does not live up to the name completely. Fortunately it mostly delivers what it promises even if it feels like a one trick pony at time.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base floats with a light presence. The scent of oatmeal cookies dominates the malt focused profile which doesnt attempt to do much more.

Flavor / Palate - Oatmeal cooling on the stove mixes with malty bread to form a dry profile. Future sips add very little to a simple but effective experience.

A local take on the average porter elevates it from mundane to a polished daily drinker. It would be fun to see a flight done with similar beans from Sunergo and other local roasters much like breweries do different barrel treatments.

Aroma / Appearance - Coffee colored fluid fills the glass and the nose. The balanced feel is light and airy but also somewhat single track. If you hate coffee then dont even bother with a taster.

The clever name masks an unusual beer that felt a little past the target season. If this circles back around for Thanksgiving I could see it being an instant hit alongside bottles of New Glarus cranberry sour.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel bronze core shimmers with a smooth laid back presence. Slightly overcooked yams cut into waffle fries fill the air with the smell of late November. Bread crust and malt round out the profile.

An unusual beer distorts the IPA and turns it into something uniquely Louisville. Like a mixture of Easter and Halloween the sweet aspects defy all expectations. If Id had to stick with just one beer it would have been this one.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze transparent base fills the air with cool hops. Feathery cotton candy melds with raw cane sugar. The yeasty core smells like the Midway of an adult themed fair.

A sessionable release that drinks with the depth youd expect from Against the Grain makes this a fine starting point for a flight. I can only hope they keep this up as they continue to grow even more.

Aroma / Appearance - A light bronze body shimmers in the daylight. Crisp white head offers shelter for the malts and sweetness that permeate the nose. Like a roll of freshly minted pennies it even throws in a cheap tangy base.

It is not common for me to run across beers that mix styles the way this release does. A memorable blend of wine and beer that manages to achieve its goals without aggressive barrel aging shoots to the top of a list of beers to sample if it happens to be on when you visit.

Aroma / Appearance - A light honey colored body and fresh white head provide the backdrop for the picnic profile in the nose. Sweet grapes, wheat, and lemon zest sparkle with freshness. The experience maintains the feel of a light white wine.

Flavor / Palate - Almonds and lemon butter open with a sweet fluid texture that refreshes the palate. Like a chilled wine it opens up with a pleasant feel on the tongue.

A mead that tastes much more like a cider or not so well done reinterpretation of New Glarus Belgian Red, the beer provides many reasons to merit at least a small pour. Usually these sort of things dont appeal to me but somehow this one manages to sneak under the radar. If youd like to try something a bit out of the ordinary then sample one of Bottlehouses specialties - the fruited mead.

Aroma / Appearance - Cherry cordial which has been slightly watered down fills the glass with a warm red core. The dusty powdery head does little to stem the tide of rising tart cherries, berries, and white wine, The dense feel is expected from the 12% ABV base.

Flavor / Palate - Like a heavier version of Rodenbach the cherries and fruit flavors burst forth on early sips. Eventually the sweetness settles down to resemble an American style sour. If you were expecting an average boozy mead without any depth look elsewhere. On the other hand if you want to sample a unique addition to Clevelands brewing scene then order a flight of whatever meads are available at the time.

The trend of using space themed names extends to a solid, if unremarkable, beer that stays true to style most of the time. Its not my favorite although it lacks any huge flaws that would make it below average if put up against beers from another local brewery. Give it a shot if you want to do a full flight; otherwise you might find four better depending on your preferences.

Aroma / Appearance - Warmth radiates from a ruby red core. Under the ivory head waves of semisweet red vines, float upwards. The effect is not unlike the snack bar at the movie theatre minus the aroma of heavily buttered popcorn. Basic and effective, there is not much else to say.

Flavor / Palate - Melting red vines flow across the tongue like liquid candy. Cherry cordial blooms during a rich transition that provides all the hallmarks of a well made red ale. Nothing really sets it apart but sometimes you dont need to do more. I might give this a shot on a return visit if the other drafts did not look overly appealing.

A nice session beer mixes a bit of the Midwest with the core of a solid brown ale. The total profile makes it hard to define precisely. Whatever you call it this draft falls squarely in the ""good enough for a pint or two"" category.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep chocolately base absorbs most of the light. A rich mocha head provides the contrast as well as slowing the rising smells of coffee and chocolate. A dry malt focused profile leans towards wheat but occasionally strays into other styles.

Flavor / Palate - Malt and wheat dominate a profile that blends two styles. While not quite seamless it gets the job done before the clean coffee transition that carries into a polished finish. Whether you call it a wheat ale or a brown ale the results get the job done. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,5.5%,BottleHouse Lone Wolf

The name alone would have sparked my interest. The execution cements this as a solid local draft that fits in well with Bottlehouses style. If low key session beers make your day then build it into a flight before you dive into the other half of the board (the meads).

Aroma / Appearance - A hazel semitransparent body glimmers with a thin white head. Dry nutty textures lend a bright crispness that deftly fades like the morning dew.

Flavor / Palate - Clean almonds sparkle lightly on the tongue. The transition floats freely to a simple finish. If I lived around the corner I would probably drink this (or beers like it) more often.  ",,Brigadier,Ohio,4.7%,BottleHouse Final Frontier

Since it is not often you stumble across blonde stouts (especially while out at a Korean restaurant) I opted to go for a beer which actually worked well with the meal. It would be fun to try again next year or whenever I come across a release again.

Aroma / Appearance - A rose gold body does not present the profile of your average stout. Just by looking you would not expect malt, caramel, and coffee. The wheat, lemon, and honey are less of a surprise. Put it all together and the profile demonstrates a deft touch.

Flavor / Palate - Wheat, honey, and almonds lighten the mood before the malty aspects take over. A slightly sweet tang tickles the tongue and throat before the coffee aspects appear. While it doesnt have the same experience as a true stout the hybrid approach gives it this unique profile that makes it more memorable than most.

A behemoth of a beer packs a punch that can be felt all the way across the river in downtown Cincinnati. You cant get much bigger than this seasonal without turning into pure soy sauce. 

Aroma / Appearance - The deep black base sticks to the edges of the glass. Crawling downwards like slime it looks like oil residue. A dense mocha head only adds to the weighty appearance. Oak, bourbon, and spiced pumpkin from a can slowly move upwards. The thick texture covers the table with sweetness as if someone wiped up recently spilled coffee, pumpkin pie, and bourbon.

Flavor / Palate - Spiced nutmeg, bourbon, and pumpkin slices stick in the throat. The whipped cream transition coats the throat in black coffee and booze. Nothing about the beer, from start to finish, attempts to be subtle. Id love to try this again with a few years on it to see how it mellows out. ",98.244,Brigadier,Colorado,16.54%,Avery Pump[KY]n

What do you get when you combine a top notch British brewer with a master of the Danish craft brewing scene (besides a much lighter wallet)? Beers such as this very well done berliner that leaves a long term mark which makes me wish I could have taken home a growler for less than a small fortune.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid caramel base radiates warmth. The light vanilla head melts away slowly. Fresh lemons, sea salt, and clean bright aromas open up the senses.

Flavor / Palate - Lemon, wheat, and citrus open with emphasis. Dusty chocolate morphs into a soft mild finish that has you reaching for the glass time after time until it is empty. If not for the price tag Id have gotten much more than a half pint. ",91.779,Brigadier,England,4.9%,Buxton / To l Sky Mountain (Himmelbjerget)

A nicely done release benefits from time in the barrel. In exchange for a slightly higher ABV it gains a mellow feel that tastes like breakfast in a glass. If coffee and fruit is your thing then try a pint if it happens to be available on your visit.

Aroma / Appearance - A dense ruby red base rests below a white vanilla head. Blueberries and oak accent each other with a texture that smells like a fresh doughy blueberry muffin.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy yogurt chased by a small shot of bourbon warms the throat. The sweet dense texture tastes like a specialty coffee from Starbucks. A well done release manages to shine despite sometimes relying a little too much on the fruity aspects. I cant wait to see what comes out of Bottlehouse once they are able to expand operations across town in Lakewood. ",,Brigadier,Ohio,8%,BottleHouse Barrel Aged Threads Of Fate
