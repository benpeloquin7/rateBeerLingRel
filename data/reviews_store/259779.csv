It flows well, brings a nice buzz (like all others) So, what Im getting at , just enjoy, nice favors thrown in.  All all in I enjoyed, Im not much of a wine drinker, prefer heavies or liquor, but this wine was sort of a delicacy. The price is veeery reasonable.  It is good.  Not 1 million dollar fly fly fine wine, but, yes, nice buzz, nice tase, it flows.  Thanks guys, enjoy.  ",43.068,BrandonDrinks,California,12%,Honeyrun Cherry Honeywine
