Pours deep black, tan head that fades quickly, no lacing. Smell has overwhelming bourbon, lots of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and a surprising banana or banana bread smell as well as oak. Slightly booze heavy but smooth drinking. Dark syrup molasses taste with bitter chocolates as well as coffee, vanilla and lots of ripe fruit, possibly prune, and tons of oak. Very sweet beer but outstanding flavor and amazing balance of bitter, sweet and booze flavored. I strongly recommend this beer to anyone who can get their hands on it.
