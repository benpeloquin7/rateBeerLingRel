And not in a good way. Initially comes across quite strong, alcoholic, and deep toasted carmel. In searching my palate for the wine and wood, I largely get band aid and medicine. On the positve, good mouthfeel and carbonation; balanced sweet and bitternee. As I drink more I get increasingly more bad funk with nuances of mouth drying wood and punchy cocoa. This beer is too much and infected. Maybe it will coalesce in a few years, but not intrigued enough to invest. Didnt finish the 22 oz bottle ",,xprmntl,Idaho,9%,Payette Hoop And Stave No. 1 - Red Wine Barrel
