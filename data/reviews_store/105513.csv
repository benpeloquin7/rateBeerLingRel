Color is dark clear gold with a white head that dissipates quickly. Taste is medium bitter on the front end, then a hint of pineapple?? toward the back of the tongue. Maybe pine. Body is light to medium; carbonation is has a nice bite; finish is bitter. I tend to like bitter beers more than sweet, so this one isnt bad. Overall, Id rate this beer pretty good, but I think Id rather load up my fridge with other varieties. Also, cool label. ",53.087,gutowski,Colorado,6.8%,Left Hand 400 Pound Monkey

Flavor on the front end was sour and very much alcohol. Then WOW! first the coffee and then the chocolate flavors came alive. There was a nice heavy bitterness and a medium sweetness that seemed appropriate for both coffee and chocolate flavors. Nice chocolate finish that lingers. Do not make the mistake I once did, drinking this after ice cream, as the butter fat coats the tongue making this beer taste sour. ",99.577,gutowski,New York,10%,Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout

Taste was sweet and fruity on the front end, malty and tart with a medium, creamy body throughout the middle. It fills your head with alcohol all the way through the spectrum of flavors. Finishes clean. While I appreciate the complexity of this beer, I tend to like something more bitter than sweet. This beer left me feeling heavy and I struggled to finish it.
