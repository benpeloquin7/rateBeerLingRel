Creamy head (common, Ive found of the Rocheforts).  Awesome, creamy mouthfeel, awesome taste start to finish.  Incredible beer and very easy to drink.  My first one was at the Cock & Bull in Sarasota, FL.  Only thing to add is that it seems highly susceptible to skunkage so either dont serve too cold or dont let temps fluctuate during transit.

I love all the Rocheforts but this is my fave in terms of flavor and drinkability.  Pours a dark, opaque black/brown color which reveals big, yummy chunks when held to the light (where it belongs!).  Much like my ChrisTania, proof that there is indeed a heaven...Nice, diminishing head with sticky lacing.  Can serve cold right out of the fridge with little or no bitterness or bite.  Head diminishes but never completely.  Each swish of the glass reveals a complex, heavenly bouquet of light bananas, sweetbread, spices, friuts, and caramel.  Flavor follows suit and is quite incredible - if this doesnt make you smile then I cant say what would...Mouthfeel is silky and drinkability is top notch.  All the Rocheforts are outstanding but I think this mid-gravity is my fave.  Its tough to distinguish perfection from perfection though... ",99.841,Moosewood,Belgium,9.2%,Rochefort Trappistes 8

Again, start to finish this ale is total enjoyment.  Similar to the 6 with the exception that I FEEL this beer warming in my stomach (alcohol?).  Pours almost opaque brown with lots of small, white sediment.  Very delicate lacing pattern, oily and quick.  Promounced, estery nose with suble hints of spicy fruits and something unexplainable - like alcohol-soaked bananas?  Complex flavors abound - sweet caramel, slight nutty bitterness, fruits, spices, sweet alcohol.  Best consumed slowly - its quite filling and alcoholic.  Quite literally a liquid meal of happy stupor!  One can easily get into trouble with this one-drinkable and alcoholic...Nice! ",,Moosewood,Belgium,11.3%,Rochefort Trappistes 10

This is no exception, and is probably my fave of the bunch.  Ranks up there with the best Ive had and its great that I dont have to travel to Belgium to get it!  Its always in stock at ABC!!!  Appearance, aroma, mouthfeel, flavor is all top notch.  No wonder that monk on the bottle is so happy!  Pours dark as night with a big, white head that diminishes but never completely and great, sticky lacing.  Complex nose and flavor (from a Belgian??? Nooooo...) of fruits, nuts, breads with maybe a hint of caramel in there.  A wonderful, slightly estery aroma that peaks around the middle of warming, mmmmm...The 10.5% is very well hidden in my opinion (better than Rochefort 10, and I LOVE all the Rocheforts!).  Overall, outstanding stuff and easily obtained.  This is a staple in my fridge... ",99.894,Moosewood,Belgium,10%,St. Bernardus Abt 12
