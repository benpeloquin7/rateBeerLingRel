One of my favorite summer beers. Sought it out from my enthusiasm that is all things Unibroue. Was not disappointed.

Belgian head was not as enormous as might have been expected. Still significant though, as was the smell eminating from the head; apples and citrus, somewhat misleading me into what I might expect.

Due to my limited experience with the more common liquor store varieties, I had nothing to compare this too. I expected a desert/fruity beer. The truth is far more complex. There are apples somewhere in this beer, but there is also a range of other tastes and flavors that add to its unexpected complexity. Im not saying this is a Westy12, but it is more complex than I would have expected. Flowery with Apple subtext, its definitely dry and tart. Would substitute for a Chardonnay in my mind.

Numerous food pairings come to mind, I see it as quite versatile.
