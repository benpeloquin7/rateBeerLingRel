A caramel, spiced beer. More bitter than Rochefort. My second favorite beer. If you like Chimay and you like Belgian Trappist ales you should try Trappistes Rochefort 10.

Great dark fruit taste, almost a chocolaty/ spiced palate. Really coats the mouth. The first thing you taste is the dark fruit, fig, raisin then you get a good spice back end and the boozyness goes so well with the fruit. Easy for an 11.3 abv. Great beer!
