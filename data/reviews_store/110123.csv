Id never seen this beer before, but liking Kolsch quite a bit and this being an authentic one, I took a chance and got a 4-pack at a discount.  Gold with a moderate white head, very fizzy - Pours a medium, lasting white head, with some lacing, over a very slightly hazy yellow body....nose is very light cereal, with hints of pear, apple....taste is light malts, hints of sweetness, with hints of pear, apple, leading to a dry lightly bitter finish....mouth feel light of medium, carbonation low adding a nice buzz on the tongue. This meets this light, delicate, but complex style quite well, and is light and refreshing.  This is the best authentic kolsch i have ever had (its the only one too, but Ive had a few American ones).  Id have to say its the best one Ive had so far, but not by much.   Pale ales, IPAs, and doulble IPAs are so prevalent in the U.S. that the Kolsch style is very refreshing, especially in summertime.  I found it to be true to what Sunner says on the label ""It is clear, pale straw colour in appearance,.  The taste is refreshing, gently fruity, slightly sweet with a crisp dry finish.:  Try it, its good stuff.
P.S. To those who have rated it way under 3 points, either you got a very bad bottle or you have no appreciation for a fine beer.  (Thats the mild version of what I was going to say.. If Id done this review after having more than one, I guarantee you the wording would have been much more damning.  Haha). Cheers!. ",39.417,Beerbo,Germany,4.8%,Snner Klsch

The house brands were reasonably priced, but the well-known brands were not.  There was one last Black Toad left, so I took a chance, knowing I would not be losing much, since the price was $5.99.  I rushed  home, immediately stuck it in the freezer and drank a Free State Oatmeal Stout while waiting for the Toad to cool.  As soon as the stout was finished, I poured the Toad.  It smelled good and looked pleasingly dark.  I hoped it would compare favorably to the stout, but wasnt expecting it to.  Well, to my surprise, it held up very well.  It doesnt taste like any other brown ale Ive had before - to me its more like a porter, but what do I know?  Anyway, its highly recommended for those looking for a black/brown bodacious beer.
