Maybe a tad too hoppy, but still very good balance with the thick carmel malt sweetness. I think it would be almost perfect if the hops were down just a touch. Not a whole lot, but just a touch. Maybe get the IBUs down from 90 to the mid 70s and youd have a real winner. First Barleywine Ive tried so I dont have much to compare to, but definitely an overall favorite.

Overall this is my favorite Stout hands down to date. Complex yet smooth. Subtle notes of Coffee, Chocolate, slight raisin & malt sweetness, with more hop finish than the average stout. Very well balanced, with no single trait too overpowering. I need to find this in the bottle to see if it stands up to the draft offering at FFF.

As I poured it into the glass, Motor Oil came to mind. Not 10W30 that comes out of the bottle, but the stuff that you drain out of the pan after its been in there for 5000 miles. The Bourbon and the alcohol burn, I can handle. What I couldnt get past was overwhelming taste of burnt prunes. Basically overpowered all the good qualities of the beer, and gave it a cough syrup quality. The other good flavors are there, you just have to look hard to find them. I would love to try one that has aged a little more to see if it balances out over time. On a side note after drinking half of the glass, I decided I wasnt really enjoying this anymore, so I dumped the remaining 6 oz into a 12 glass of Bass. Ended up with what was actually quite a fantastic, and still coal black stout.
