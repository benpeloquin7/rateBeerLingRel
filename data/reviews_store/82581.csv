Not at all a fan of typical Pumpkin beers, this one is different, and good. It&apos;s color is to be expected from the style, the aroma is blatant gal spices, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar. Taste is what surprised me. Not a typical seasonal pumpkin, but, as the name implies, sweet &apos;tater. It is actually a beer that makes you want to try it again and again. It&apos;s finish is fairly clean with slight lingering clove. 

Even if you are not a fan if the style (like myself), try it and see for yourself. You know what you like. This one sort of pleasantly surprised me.  ",,elmillero,Illinois,,Ridgebrook Sweet Tater

From pour to finish, all things in between that I experience are what appeals to me as the deFacto IPA.  An IPA that others will be compared against.  It is clean, full flavor, jus a bit less mouthfeel that I feel it could be but it makes up for that in all other traits of its character. It feels, and is Double Jack&apos;s little brother, but in a real good way. I hope my beer store can maintain its inventory with this, as it is currently the best I can get in an IPA.

If I can&apos;t find something at the beer store and this is available I will always walk out with a bomber of Lagunitas Hop Stoopid.  

In my opinion this is one of the most perfect Imperial IPAs I&apos;ve ever had. I am a huge fan of the hop and this brew completely satisfies. 

All elements of this beer, it&apos;s sight it&apos;s smell/aroma it&apos;s taste it&apos;s mouth feel it&apos;s finish are all incomparable. This is definitely one of my top five Island beers.

Traditionally they are Bavarian style brewing Company.  While I appreciate the Bavarian style of beers,  I&apos;m usually not a big fan, however this was a very Solid barley wine and a very pleasant
surprise. While it&apos;s a bit pricey, it is worth trying at least once maybe twice for the experience.

I will be purchasing This at least one more time, it is just that good.

Mouth feel was thin. Not a whole lot of whiskey notes or barrel notes either. As for a porter, the mouth feel had little body and needs more viscosity.  At 6% alcohol by volume I am very disappointed as I am a big fan of six row other beers.

Aroma: Not excessively hoppy, but floral, citrus and toasted malt notes present. 

Feel: Somewhat silky, not oily, low astringent; enough cleansing for the next bite of food. 

Taste: Maple, chocolate with some vanilla notes, middle, nice malt to hop balance.  Citrusy, orange note finish. 

Overall, I am a big fan of this Imperial IPA since I first had it 2 yr. ago. It is a perfect &apos;last one (or 2)&apos; of the night. Can&apos;t really session it, I believe it is meant to be something special, and it is. A sipper to be enjoyed and savored with your better half during a Blu-ray viewing of your favorite flick, or whatever relaxes you. If you have it available in your region, get a 4 pack, if not, find a relative or friend who lives where it is sold and have them get some to you
