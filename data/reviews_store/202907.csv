Obviously this is not a traditional beer so if you buy it expecting so, youre gonna have a bad time. This beer has a strong flavor of apple pie and cinnamon. Light body and head. Good dessert beer.

As a fan of brown ales, I really enjoyed Kona Breewerys unique toasted coconut brown ale. Despite the strong aroma and flavor of coconut this beer has a high drinkablity.
