This is the 16.1% ABV version, and it has been sitting on my shelf --shrouded in darkness, away from excessive cold and heat-- for the past year, waiting for the perfect occasion. And yesterday, that occasion finally came.

And it looks pretty! Pitch black, tiny bubbles slowly rising to the surface to for a beautiful, small but solid brown head. The promises it makes!
The aromas are not excessively powerful. Theres roasted malts in there, of course, some coffee, the darkest of chocolate, but it doesnt quite jump out of the glass. Thats fine, though, time to taste!

And thats where this beer lost me, Im afraid. Its sweet. Very sweet. Excessively sweet. Its also alcoholic (Im glad I didnt have it fresh), which when combined with the sweetness feels particularly aggressive. And as if Mikkeller werent satisfied with clobbering us over the head with the Blacks ABV and residual sugars, its also aggressively bitter. AGGRESSION AGGRESSION AGGRESSION, is all Im getting from this beer.

Mind you, the coffee and dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are divine, but Im simply not given the room to enjoy them. I couldnt finish the bottle (I stored the rest, but Im not sure I still feel like drinking it), which to me just says it all.

To me, this beer is pure posturing. No-nonsense, hardcore flavors coming from every direction, but little skill and no finesse.

Allow me to redirect you to the Double Black instead? ",97.538,coren42,Denmark,17.5%,Mikkeller  / Black

The aromas are typical saison: hay, a bit of dried grass, a sweeter note. The taste is typical De La Senne: its clean, its dry, and it finishes with a medium-strong clean bitterness. The difference with their other brews is the obvious saison yeast influence, which adds in subtle barnyard impressions: again the hay, and a spicy fruitiness. The flavors remain mild, though, and the overall impression is a rather watery one, which is a bit disappointing. The mouth feel is spot on, though.

I only saw the 4% ABV after finishing this one, and I have to say that Im much more impressed with this beer when taking this new information into account. For such a low alcohol brew, it does some interesting things. Its also perfectly executed, but I wouldnt expect anything less from De La Senne.

But ""knowing"" and ""feeling"" are very different things, and what I take away from this brew is that its not bad, but its a bit watery, and its ultimately forgettable. ",92.803,coren42,Belgium,4%,De la Senne Saison du Meyboom
