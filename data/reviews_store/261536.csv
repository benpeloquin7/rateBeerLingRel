Unlike any porter Ive come across, this one pours a thin dark brown/barely black with a small head. Quite clear and see through for a beer of this type.

Flavor was distinctly unlike other porters I have had. Whereas Hoynes Dark Matter has a crisp and satisfying taste of milk chocolate and roasted malt and Okanagan Springs Porter is a decidedly rich and slightly licorice-flavored specimen, this one cuts across the tongue with a flavor of piney hops mixed with the taste of stale coffee grinds. Simply put, it was awful. The hops nearly dominate the flavor of this beer.
