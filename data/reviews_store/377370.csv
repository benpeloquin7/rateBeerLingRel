If you are an aficionado of Bok or Hungarian Bak beers this may be a little to light for you. But a good beer nonetheless and very drinkable, not too sweet, good malty, slightly nutty taste. Only 199Ft or 0.45 per half liter bottle at Auchan in Budapest... Good choice to give to friends. ",39.261,budapestjohn,Czech Republic,4.4%,Staropramen ern (Dark/Temn)
