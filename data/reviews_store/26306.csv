This is certainly the most disgusting mainstream beer ive had. It tastes like beer mixed with Sparks alc-energy drink. And if you dont know what that tastes like, its kind of like (is?) oversugared orange tang mixed with really bad vodka. And B to the E captures that taste, but mixed with Budweiser. Ill pass, this fails. ",0.441,Boyz2pepsi,Missouri,6.6%,Bud Extra (B-to-the-E)

Oh...whats not to like. Coffee, chocolate, cream, and of course, that dark beer flavor we love. its a little different from most dark beers in that it needs to be a little colder to enjoy its flavors - otherwise the bitterness is just a little too overpowering. If you can be so precise, go for about 50 degrees. My favorite part about this beer has to be how it never weighs on you - it dosnt fill you up, nor does it make you crave a lemon to suck on if you drink too much.
