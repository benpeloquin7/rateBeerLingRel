Lots of carbonation bring the aroma of sour/tartness to the nose. No hops or malts to speak of, flavor reminiscent of infected home brew. Overall, generally unpleasant.

Appearance, crystal clear, deep red with fine bubbles. Head a little thin, quickly dissapating. Aroma, figs, dark chocolate and floral. Taste is clean, medium/balanced bitterness at the front that fades to a lightly bitter-sweet after taste. Palate, nicely balanced carbonation and body give, perhaps slightly astringent.

Overall, nothing kicks you in the teeth, but thats what I would expect here. You can drink these all day long without getting bored. ",,ScaryCar,Montana,5.7%,Fat Jacks 90 Schilling Scottish Ale
