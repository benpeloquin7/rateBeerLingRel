A-Body is a pale completely transparent bronze colored body. Bubbles can be seen steadily rising to the top. Pours with a 2 finger or so head. Some lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Overall impression of the nose is sweet an bready. Floral and slightly grassy hop overtones are present as well as a mild yeasty funk.

T- Flavor is similar to the taste-but is quite a different story. The big bitter floral and grassy hop profile chimes in right away with a sugary sweet bready yeast backbone, and a hint of funk. All the flavors intensify for the finish and the hops fade a bit but then come back in with a bitter floral lash. This lingers on for awhile with a mild spiciness.

M- Medium to high carbonation and lightweight full body.

D- This is a very good beer overall and one of the best that flying dog makes. Over the past year or so I have become a HUGE fan of Belgian IPAs-and while this one is good and definately fits to the style it doesnt measure up to a lot of other great examples of the style.

A- Body is a dark brown hue. Served with a 1 finger or so creamy creme brulee colored head. This fades to a >1/2 finger but has decent retention. No lacing left behind in the glass.

S- The nose is very good and interesting. It actually has a lot of smoked peat to it-it accents the nose. Behind this is a classic milk stout. Milk chocolate and a hint of roasted malt.

T- Taste is very similar to the smell. Upfront is that smokeyness with a chocolate malt backbone. The milk component comes through more for the finish as well as a hint of roasted malt and the smoke fades completely for the finish.

M- Medium carbonation and fairly heavy body. Smooth but slightly dry.

D- This is a very good, interesting milk stout overall. I really like the added smoke quality to the typical milkm stout profile-it adds a hint of rauchbier to it. Its just a hair dry-but overall job very well done by rust belt.

A- Being that this was a nitro-tap the appearance is perfect. Served with a wonderful frothy, creamy 3 finger or so creme brulee colored head. Perfect retention at 1 finger with lacing all the way down the glass. Body is a treanslucent, nearly opaque dark brown hue.

S- Yep. The nose is pretty much what you would expect when you read/hear about/see a chocolate beer. Nose is very rich of thick, dark chocolate. Bittersweet with the accent on the sweet, a hint of toffee as well.

T- Flavor is very similar to the taste. Flavor is very rich and chocolatey. Liquid bittersweet chocolate with the faintest hints of roasted malt and toffee deep in the background.

M- Low to medium carbonation and a rich, thick, smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

D- This is an excellent stout and pretty much fits the deScription. A chocolate stout with more chocoloate added to it. Its like the triple chocolate cake of beers. I really liked this beer but I see it as somewhat more of a novelty brew-but it really is one of the better single stouts I have had. This really reminds me of Southern Tier Choklat-its just as thick and rich-but the alcohol is not there. Its a shade sweeter as well.

A- Body is a translucent, nearly opaque dark brown body. A rather aggressive pour still leaves this beer flat-with absolutely no head. Flat abbey strikes again (actually Ive had probably 20 or so brews from them and this is only the second or third flat one).

S- Nose is potent and pretty much as the bottle describes-A ton of caramel malt and bourbon characteristics, as well as a good amount of alcohol astringency. A mild to moderate amount of wet oak looms in the background as well as the slightest touch of toffee and chocolate.

T-Overall impression of the taste is slightly sweet, slightly boozy. Its got a good bit of caramel and molasses to it and the heat comes in up front. Letting the sip linger on the palate really brings out a lot of complexity with chocolate, oak, and toffee- the finish has a touch of what seems to be an impression of candi sugar before the heat returns-and lingers on and on.

M- Mild carbonation and a thick, viscous body that would be ultra velvety smooth if it wasnt for the alcohol consistency/astringency with a moderate presence. The feel isnt nearly as flat as the appearance.

D- This is an interesting beer overall. Kind of comes off as a BA scotch ale-which is a very cool concept-and I havent tried many. The bourbon is a little hot and heavy and I probably could have been a bit more patient with this one.

S- Nose is pretty typical for a wit. Bready yeast, a touch of citrus and coriander, and a hint of soapiness as well.

S- The belgian stout has a strange nose- milk, spicy belgian yeast, dark chocolate, a hint of funk, and a hint of roasted malt.

T- Taste is very similar to the nose-only comes off more as a roasted milk stout. There is an underlying hint of Belgian yeast-but the milkiness, roasted malt, and coacoa take precidence.

M- Medium to high carbonation-a nice, smooth velvety mouthfeel, smooth and creamy.

D- Actually overall I find this beer to be quite odd. I love belgians and I love stouts-but belgian stouts-and for that matter-sour porters/stouts or weirder to my palate than the American Black Ale. Its fairly enjoyable and yes very drinkable-but weird-the fact that this is funky and not sour is certainly a benefit.

S- Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a hint of pine in the back. Roasted malt is the main character.

T- Upfront is actually a good amount of herbal hops, a hint of spicy hops, and a hint of citrus, behind this is a huge coffee roasted malt backbone. The finish offers a big dose of refreshing pine in the back and a mild amount of roasted malt lingers.

M- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body.

D- This is another interesting ""black ale"". Although this one isnt as bright and doesnt seem to be as complex as EITHER- the flavors blend together a lot better and this doesnt seem to be as much of a contrast. Overall both are pretty good beers.

T- Smooth creamy dark chocolate and woody flavors highlight (somewhat) upfront, minimal honey and cedar-accents of citrus above this.

S- A sour tartness, a hint of vinegar, and a deep raspberry juice background- slightly sweet, slightly tart, slightly dry. A hint of vanilla and a hint of oak as well.

T- Taste is very similar to the nose. A sour tartness comes though the most initially of moderate strength-as well as tart raspberries in the background-the raspberries become more complex-slightly sweet and a slight oak characteristic comes through way in the background. The vinish is dry and quite tart, slightly tart, slightly vinegary- all to coll pretty quickly and leave the slightest impression of raspberries.

M-Medium to high carbonation and a full medium weight body-slightly dry.

D- This is a fantastic lambic overall- it makes me want to seek out more cantillon, drie fontien, etc...it is quite tart-but has a lot of complexity to offer-these beers are expensive-but worth it.

Thanks Jusitn for sending this my way!

A- Body is a very translucent, nearly opaque dark orange hue. Pours with a very nice 2-3 finger foamy white head which settles nicely at 1/2 finger and leaves plenty of lacing behind in the glass.

S- Citrus, mango, pineapple, caramel, and a slightly woody background. I would say that the pineapple is most prominent. There is also an accent of pine hops in the nose.

T- Initial flavor is filled with exotic fruit, citrus and an accent of pine hops, with actually-a slightly bready yeast backbone. The finish is interesting as the pine flavor comes through a little bit more, as well as pineapple and exocitc fruit sweetness, and a light wood flavor- the hops then the hop bitterness kicks in and lingers on at a moderate strength for awhile.

M- high tingly carbonation-and a very prickly, but very smooth, medium weight body-very interesting and good.

D- This is a very interesting brew overall. Its fantastic-but it has way too much pineapple for my tastes (which really isnt all that much)- which brings it down to just very good. I give this beer a lot of credit for pulling off both the fresh hoppy characteristics of a fresh IPA and the smooth mouthfeel of a barrel aged, bottle conditioned beer-this is a very good, complex IPA overall.

T- Flavor is much more soft and well balanced than the nose. Tart apple and a hint of pear come through initially. A very mild yeast backbone is behind this. The overtones are boozy initially and the finish has the lightest touch of floral hops, belgian sugar, a moderate alcohol astringency, and a very large alcohol heat.

A- Body is a murky light orangeish/reddish pink hue. Pours with a 1 finger or so off white head that fades to a thick collar and little to no lacing is left behind in the glass. Many tiny particles are suspended throughout the brew and collected on the bottom-indeed a bloody beer.Unfortunately-as I drink it-the novelty wears off and it becomes more cloying 7-8oz is great 8-10 is plenty 10-12oz is way too much


S- pale malt, vegetable juice (V8 like but not as thick), salt-well there you have it-what else to expect from a bloody mary beer?

T- Salt comes through the most initially with some tomato and celery over a pale malt base. A hint of pilsner like flavor comes through for the finish along with more salt and celery, and a mild peppery spice. A hint of salt and pilsner flavor linger.

M- Medium to high carbonation and a light, crisp and drinkable body-salt is minimal.

D- I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. The thought of a bloody mary beer scared me-but this is light, drinkable, and impressionistic. Its everything I like about a bloody mary without the gross tomato paste consistency. Job well done by shorts. This is 8.5%? No I dont believe that.

I got this awhile from a New England BA-have been cellaring it and very excited to try it. Finally opening it and trying it now! Poured into my crazy french large snifter.

A- Body is a very cloudy straw yellow. Fogginess is uniform and bubbles can be seen through the thick fog rising to the top. Pours with a large 2-3 finger foamy white head which doesnt seem to want to settle. 

S- Nose has witbier written all over it. Coriander, chamomile, citrus, bready yeast. What is different about this brew is the essence of soaked oak and a hint of vanilla- the barrel characteristics blend with the base beer very nicely and offer a new complexity to this type of brew.

T- The dry spices come through the most intitially in the flavor. Behind this is citrus and a hint of barrel. The yeast is there but overshadowed by everything else going on in the brew. The dry spiciness intensifies for the finish and a splash of vanilla sweetness as well as soaked oak comes through for the finish. A hint of sitrus and spice lingers.

M- Medium to high carbonation and a light, but full drinkable body-with a slight soaked woody and juicy citrus consistencies.

D- This is a great beer overall. Very unique to try a barrel aged witbier-and a style that works well in a barrel-IMO. Hoping to see more beers like this in 2011.

A- Body is a very hazy translucent, light brass hue. Pours with a nice 2-3 finger foamy white head. Head eventually hades to 1.5 fingers and leaves lacing all the way down the glass.

S- Brett funk dominates the nose. Behind this is a big wave of bright cirtus and apricot. A mild peppery spice can also be detected.

T- Moderate lemon upfront before the brett funk takes over and grabs hold. Peppery spice overtones initially and an accent of floral hops. The finish is quite bitter and funky-it offers more intense brett funk, peppery spice and a moderate floral hop bitterness as well as a hint of lemon. Brett funk and floral hop bitterness linger on for awhile.

M- High tingly carbonation and a light to medium weight body loaded with brett funk.

D- I really like this beer-it reminds me of a hoppy saison loaded with brett (Im a huge fan of funky saisons so this works well for me) The brett is a bit extreme-but the complexity and drinkablility of this shine as the beer warms. This brew is certainly wild and funky-but NOT sour-and perhaps thats why the review score isnt that high. The more I drink of this the more I like it-the only thing is I cant find the barrel in any components of this beer.

A- Body is a translucent medium red/mahogany hue. Fogginess is mild to moderate and slightly dynamic. Pours with a nice 1-2 finger creamy, slightly off white head which fades to and has great retention at 1/2 finger.

S- Nose is complex and colorful. Lots of soaked oak barrel, a hint of vanilla, vinegar, a slightly acidic tartness, sour apple, brett funk, a hint of cherry and dark fruit in the background. The nose is balanced and moderate to strong.

T- An acidic tartness is first to hit the palate along with impressions of cherry, brett funk and sour apple. This quickly turns as the soaked oak barrel shines through with a sweet vanilla like impression accompanying it-if you let it linger on the palate a fair amount of vinegar comes through and sticks around long after the swallow-if you dont let it stick around the vinegar goes virtually unnoticed. The barrel and vanilla flavors intensify for the finish as the acidic tartness and cherries come back around but are fairly mild-an overall mild balance between all these components lingers on the palate.

M- Light to medium prickly carbonation. A light to medium weight smooth and creamy body that isnt quite full.

D- This is a very interesting flanders red-where the nose is bright and exciting-the flavor is much softer-but has the same delicate complexity and balance. Its not heavy on tartness, vinegar, barrel, or fruit-its a nice balance of all of these. Its a great sipper.

D- This is an overall VERY GOOD imperial stout. The nose suggests RIS-but the flavor brings out a classic american imperial stout-and I would expect nothing less of Sierra Nevada.

T- Flavor is much more balanced than the nose. Vanilla and bourbon sweetness upfront with a nice, rich, chocolately backbone as well as soaked oak components.

M- Low to medium carbonation and a thick velvety body.

D- This is a very good stout overall. Its sweet and hot in alcohol. I would think of this as more of a dessert beer than anything else. Right now-the bourbon is the highlight. Id like to get ahold of another bottle and let this age for a bit-as regular bourbon county blossoms after about 2 yrs or so. As with most stouts-this one gets better as it warms-the complexity really shows.

D- This is an awesome beer overall. Its very strong and hoppy-but offers complexity with the hoppiness and a solid malt backbone. Its too bad this is one time only and draft only.

S- Nose is moderate in strength and is quite sweet. Caramel, toffee, molasses. Not as thick and heavy as examples of the style higher in ABV- but good and on-par for the style.

2009 Juliet- bottled on my birthday :). This is also the review # that corresponds with the day I was born (not planned at all). This was a crazy gusher which made quite an event at our family gathering. Poured into my duck rabbit snifter (~10 oz). 

A- Body is a dark translucent pink color with uniform fogginess. Pours with a very foamy light pink head which suprisingly doesnt take long to settle to 1/2 finger and very little lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is quite tart-with an acidic tartness striking first, behind this is raspberry, a hint of vinegar, and a hint of funk-the main character is the acidic tartness.

T- As with the nose the acidic tartness is the first to come through in the flavor-at a moderate strength-behind this is dry raspberry and a hint of funk. The tartness quickly fades and almost disappears for the finish allowing a dry mild berry flavor to shine. Nothing really lingers on the palate.

M- Carbonation is quite high and tingly with a lightweight, slightly dry body.

D- This is a very good wild ale overall. The highlight is the tartness-but overall its mild to moderate with a clean finish. This was a good sour to start the family off with as its not really offensive.

D- This is good, very interesting brew. It really has a margarita feel to it-and I like Magaritas. The tequila is good-but a little hot. I do wish this brew werent a one time thing and Id like to see more tequila brews out there.

HUGE thanks to Brian for sending this my way!

A-Body is a nearly transparent light amber hue. Bubbles can be seen all over the place. Pours with a perfect two finger or so foamy white head with perfect retention. Lacing left all the way down the glass.

S- Nose is awesome. Perfect. Citrus hops and white grapefruit everywhere. A faint sweet malt backbone can be detected as well. Very rich and citrusy.

T- Complex for an IPA and different hop impressions emerge with each sip. Citrus initially, then a touch of herbal and grassy, then a touch of pine and spicy at the end. The citrus is very bright initially then fades off the grassy and herbal remain contantly in the background. The pine is very mild and much more resiny than bright. A really big hop bitterness lingers on and on-citrus and pine resin with a big spicy hop overlay.

M-Medium to high carbonation and a slightly smooth and oily light to medium weight body.

D- Fantastic DIPA overall-complex and certainly in my top five-its a bit to bitter to take the #1 spot for me. Its certainly a hop bomb. Reminds me of my experience with PtY-although that was almsot 2 yrs ago. I hope the Alchemist keeps releasing this because it is a must try DIPA!
