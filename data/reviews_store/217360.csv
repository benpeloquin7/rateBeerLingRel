Compared to some other reviews, I found that the bitterness was not harsh, and that the beer was surprisingly light and smooth for a 9.1% ABV brew. Not at all the brute I expected, but rather a very smooth, slightly sweetish, mellow and balanced IIPA. Goes down as easy as any IPA I have had. Really enjoyed this one.

Shipwreck is NOT simply Switchback re-named. It is not a Pacific NW style IPA, and lacks the citrus/grapefruit, melon and pine aroma and flavour. It is now labeled as a ""modern"" style IPA. Not sure why they abandoned Switchback, perhaps because they wanted to do something the other local craft breweries werent doing, but I wish theyd ""switch back"" to Switchback. Shipwreck is a light beer with lots of flat bitterness but no depth, malt or aroma. Sorry, but I would substitute the ""p"" with a ""t"".
