While at one air base we were allowed two beers, twice a week.  Since this was a Russian speaking country we had, of course, Russian beers to choose from.  Due to only being allowed two beers, we all went for the highest alcohol content we had to choose from.  No. 6 was the highest content in the biggest bottle....We have a Winner!  The odd fact is that this was a really good beer.  I was blown away at how good aroma and body was.  Rich chocolatey malt flavor with a kick.  If I could find this beer locally, I would keep some on hand all the time.  Very good brew! ",85.909,USAFRuss,Russia,7%,Baltika 6 Porter

Smelled like molasses and hops to me.  The odd shaped bottle and size (11.2 oz) with a thermal decal letting you know it was the right temp to drink were neat.  I had a similar Russian beer in Kyrgyzstan and was looking to duplicate that.  I was not dissappointed ,35.639,USAFRuss,Russia,5%,Afanasiy Temnoe (Afanasy Tver Beer Dark)
