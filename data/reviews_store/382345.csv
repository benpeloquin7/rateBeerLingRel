Resin and pine, citrus abound. Sweet caramel. Absolutely beautiful brew going down a treat right now. Will drink many more over Summer. This beer is definitely one of the best Australian beers being made today. Certainly I cannot think of a better Australian brewed beer in the style although there are a few that do come close. Cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful brew.  ",94.655,BryanL1982,Australia,6.8%,Mash Brewing Copycat AIPA
