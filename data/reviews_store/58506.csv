I had this on tap at The Salty Caper in Salisbury, NC and liked it so much I went to the Vintage Porter in Salisbury to buy a few bottles to bring home.  This is my favorite beer to date.  Very hard to describe because it has so much flavor.  There are hints of several fruits, chocolate, and malty sweetness.  The high alcohol content is a bit much at first but I got over that fast and just enjoy it now. ",91.918,jdrober1,Belgium,8%,Maredsous 8 Brune/Bruin
