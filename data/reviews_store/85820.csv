Pours a clear gold-amber with tall thick off-white head. Nose has citrus and lemon zest, grapefruit too; some floral herbal notes but fairly weak in aroma. First taste is tart citrus, grapefruit, bread and a bit sweet but with dry finish. Good hoppy flavor, not bitter. Palette is above average and creamy, round, soft. I like this; its a good every day IPA.

Light gold mostly clear with tall white pillowy head. Leaving nice lacing. A little funky, some coriander and spice in the nose. Malt is very light biscuit, citrus hops. Taste starts with strong bitterness and then floral and fruit malt. Finishes with a good dose of piney tart bitterness. Not representative of the relatively low IBUs and ABV. Above average mouth feel with low carbonation. I like it, good easy drinking pale ale.
