Thats not to say its a bad beer though. The smell has some citrus, mango, and grassy notes. The flavor is grassy and floral with some lemon and a hint of pineapple, but the malt comes through to balance it more than Id expected it to and brings caramel and buttered bread to the mix. If youre looking for a hop explosion, this isnt it. Overall though, its a pretty flavorful beer. The ingredients are quality and it has just enough complexity to keep me wanting more.

Hops, hops, and more hops. The hops are very prominent but balanced by the honey and not quite overpowering, but close.
