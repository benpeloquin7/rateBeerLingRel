The first thing that strikes you about this beer is its wonderful coffee aroma.  Im not a huge coffee fan, but this brew had just the right amount of coffee aroma and flavor to where I could really enjoy it.  Medium body, sort of light for stout, and black to the point it was not translucent.  Overall, a very enjoyable ale that was crafted for maximum drinkability.
