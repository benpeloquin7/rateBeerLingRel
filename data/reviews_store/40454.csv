This beer pours a redish brown with a minimal head. First thing I smell is alcohol, which is strange because its doesnt have a high content. Once it wears off I smell some holiday spice and a little caramel and ginger. The taste is bitter off the start but finishes with a slight sweetness. Overall Id say its a nice holiday ale from Sam. Recommended, although id probably prefer it on tap. ",73.203,optemoz,Massachusetts,5.9%,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale
