Poured in a La Trappe chalice. Moderate, pale tan head, dissipates fairly quickly. Dark, rich, malty, a little earthy, with a sweet, black cherry note. Smooth, full, and rather sweet on the palate. Spices, fruit, earth on complex, lingering finish. Is this the best beer I&apos;ve ever had? Don&apos;t know; I haven&apos;t drunk them all. But it&apos;s pretty damn good.
