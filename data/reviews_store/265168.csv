Never gave much thought to cider prior to OS. Had only partaken in such low quality ciders as Woodchuck, Strongbow, etc. But OS opened my mind to the potential of ciders and how enjoyable they really can be. To be truthful, its not exceptional, but for the price its damn good. . Much better (and better for you) than Inbev (Johnny Appleseed) or MillerCoors (Smith & Forge) offerings. Its at the same price point in my area as Angry Orchard, yet much drier and more refined. Its not an ultra-premium hand crafted cider like some local offerings here in Richmond, VA as in Blue Bee, Albemarle Cider Works, or Potters, but its not priced to be.

Expect an effervescent, clean tasting cider, that leans toward off-dry but in comparison to similarly priced 6-pack ciders out there it would have to be considered a dry. Good, not great, but extremely drinkable. Cheers! ",24.786,Scrumpditty,New York,6%,Original Sin Hard Cider

Looks a lot like champagne or sparkling Chardonnay (hints the name Charred Ordinary Im sure).

Not much in the nose, but pleasant with a light apple scent. If I didnt pour it myself, Id feel like I was about to have a glass of sparkling wine.

Hits the palate with bubbly crispness followed immediately with a wave of dry, tart cider. Very light body. Its all apple taste here folks, not even a hint of any back sweetener. It doesnt need it. Light, refreshing, crisp, tart, and freaking delicious!

Hands down, best hard cider Ive encountered and Ive tried many American and European ciders. Im very fortunate to live in Richmond, where its made, so there are several retail outlets locally. Otherwise, Id be paying a hefty price to import this amazing cider.

Charred Ordinary is by far my favorite, but of course Im a big dry cider fan. If you like your cider a bit on the sweeter side, try their Aragon 1904. Still, no back sweetener used, but it is quite a bit sweeter simply from their use of different apple varieties.

My recommendation, try both! Cheers!  ",89.495,Scrumpditty,Virginia,8.3%,Blue Bee Charred Ordinary
