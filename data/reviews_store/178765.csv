An onslaught of mango, as well as pineapple, guava, papaya, grapefruit, orange, and a candied sweetness. A slight dank quality to it. As it warms, a butterscotch note comes out from the malt. If there was an air freshener that smelled like this, I would buy it on the spotsmells amazing. Taste is just as good. Starts with lots of mango, papaya, and grapefruit, but also has a nice sweetness and butterscotch flavor to accompany it. The finish is wonderful. Tropical and citrus fruits galore. Papaya, guava, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit rind, a slight herbal (almost piney) note, a ""cat piss"" quality, along with a candied sweetness that gives the fruits a juicy quality to them. Slightly dry on the finish. A slight abrasiveness to it, but with the sweetness it is not overbearing at all. High medium body with a creamy, yet oily mouthfeel. The nice, sweet malt balance, along with the amazingly complex and juicy hop profile make this double ipa stand out. If you are a citra hop fan, seek this out.

Get a nice addition of dough and toffee from the malts in the middle. The finish is pretty resinous and brings notes of melon, grapefruit, tropical fruit, pine, and grass. Get a little malt character too to balance it a little, but the finish still leaves a lingering abrasive bitter taste. Also get some booze on the finish and definitely warms you up.

Lively carbonation. Smells grass, belgian yeast, little funk, a tiny bit of lemon or lime, pepper.  Taste starts with bright flavors of lemon and grass. Then is followed in the middle by the belgian yeast, some peppery spice, slight breadiness. Then the finish is more of the belgian yeast, some light funkiness, some light citrus notes like lemon and grapefruit,  more spiciness, some slight floral notes, sweet breadiness from the malt. Creamy, refreshing mouthfeel. High medium body. This was supposed to be drank by January, which was two months ago. Still in pretty good shape with some hop qualities, but Im sure it is far better beer fresh. Not too bad. ",98.352,brewskis,Missouri,8.5%,Boulevard Smokestack Series - Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale

Finger length off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick lacing around the edges. Smells of mostly coffee beans, as well as some vanilla/carmel, bakers chocolate, and some roasted malt. Taste starts with intense, roasted coffee beans. Much stronger taste than the aroma suggests. Almost imparts an earthy flavor from the coffee beans. Then smooths out in the middle. Get some vanilla or carmel that acts like a coffee creamer and lightens the intensity of the coffee. Then the finish brings back some intense coffee flavors, in addition to some carmel, some bittersweet chocolate, as well as some bitterness from the fairly heavy hop presence. Sweetness increases as the flavor profile moves on. Pretty full body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Lively carbonation that reminds you that this is an imperial porter, not an imperial stout, and makes the beer much more refreshing for a full-bodied beer. No alcohol detected in the smell or taste.

Resinous, yet sweet smelling. Taste starts with lots of hop qualities as expected: resinous pine, orange, mango, papaya. Sweet even in the beginning. May of added some dextrose sugar. The the middle brings a modest malt backbone. More than I detected in the taste. A light biscuity note, as well as some sweet carmel and grain. The finish does an excellent job of showing off the hop qualities, yet still staying pretty balanced. Lots of tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, papaya, as well as resinous grass, pine, floral notes. Tastes a lot like different flavored gummi worms. Little hint of alcohol.

Thought there would be more hops on the nose. Taste starts with some resinous hop qualities such as grapefruit, pine, and orange rind. Then in the middle the hop qualities take a back seat to the malts. Lots of carmel, toffee, breadiness, some molasses or brown sugar. Then the finish is more of the heavy malt presence: lots of sweetness and breadiness, as well as raisin, but more of the resinous hops show through as well. More complex hops flavors show through on the end such as floral, grass, and resin. Some booze on the finish that provides a warming sensation on the way down. Tastes very much like Bells This One Goes to 11 when it warms, as the hops show through much more. A pretty full body with a thick, creamy, and oily mouthfeel.

Tons of sediment, but that is expected with the amount of yeast added. Smells of funky, sour cherries, oak, vinegar, grapes, lots of funkiness. Lots of dryness that really does give it a wine-like smell. Smells almost like a cherry warhead. Taste starts with a very astringent, dry, sour cherry flavor, as well as some oak and funkiness. Then get some of the brown ale qualities: slight breadiness, maybe some cocoa (but i could just be imagining that), some carmel malt. Then the astringent sour notes from the brett and bacteria come back even stronger, along with lots more cherry, grape, funkiness, vinegar, oak, some carmel. Extremely dry finish that blends the wine and the beer qualities nicely. So sour, yet extremely balanced. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation from the refermentation that does give it a very champagne-like crisp finish. Very complex and so delicious.

Just enough malt to just cut some of the bitterness from the massive amounts of hops. Definitely do get booze on the finish as well, but that is expected at almost 12%.
