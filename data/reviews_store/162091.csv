The malt profile is great, sweet and complex but not cloying, and the subtle Belgian yeast character is very nice.  However, the predominant flavor I get is an onion bomb, I am assuming from the hops.  For me, the onion character ruins what could have been an excellent beer.

The overpowering banana aroma had me scared.  This is subdued in the flavor however, which is dominated by wheat malt, stone fruit, and a peppery finish.  The mouthfeel is excellent, with a chewy body balanced by a bright clean finish.  Just the right amount of bitterness, and no hop aroma.  Some alcohol is definitely evident.  Very enjoyable and versatile overall. ",97.702,Yodrei,Germany,7.7%,Weihenstephaner Vitus

Aroma of sticky sweet malts, port wine, and vanilla, with no hops evident.  Burnt orange color with minimal head.  Sweet flavors of  caramel malt and plum are just balanced by clean hop bitterness, with subdued but spicy hop flavor, and lively carbonation.  Alcohol is hidden extremely well.  Overall it starts out a bit thick, but gets better as you drink it.   Satisfying beer, will buy more to pair with a nice cut of red meat or rich dessert.

Great aroma- mainly citrus, some vanilla and clove.  Light straw color, slightly cloudy.  Thick persistent head.  The predominant flavors were grassy hops and crisp dry malts (rye and wheat).  Their deScription (effervescent, dry, hoppy and crisp) is right on.  Overall, I felt the beer was unbalanced- too much crisp, and not enough sweetness or fruit for balance.  Interesting, and definitely a quality beer, but I did not enjoy it overall.  Could benefit from serving on the warm side. ",96.761,Yodrei,California,8.5%,The Bruery Mischief
