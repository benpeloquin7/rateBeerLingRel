Color is a nice cloudy amber with little apparent carbonation.  Tough to smell much except for faint hops and onion? and pine.  Alcohol is not apparent, tough to believe that this is an 11%!  Very well hidden in a slightly copper, metallic, hoppy back end.  Front flavor and mouthfeel doesnt offer much, seems to be just a vehicle to get you to the hops on the back.  I would buy it again, but it wasnt my favorite from Southern Tier.   ",98.673,schlomo,New York,9.5%,Southern Tier Un*Earthly

Pure white head with tight white small bubbles that dissipated quickly.  Moderate lacing.  Smells fresh and non-complex.  Not as hoppy or deep as other Southern Tier beers that I have sampled.  I purchased this in Chautauqua County, NY.  Supposed to be only for sale in this area.  Can be found on draft in many of the local restaurants in the area.  Good fresh simple drinking/summer beer.
