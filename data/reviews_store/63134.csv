For proper enjoyment, there should be a slice of orange on the glass that you then place into the beer (much like a lime with a Corona).  This does a lot to activate the citrus in the beer and made it very quickly my favorite beer of all time.  If you are not getting a slice of orange, or worse, eating it instead of placing it in the beer, then of COURSE youre not going to like it. ",16.189,Paulie76,Canada,5.4%,Rickards White
