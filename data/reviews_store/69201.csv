Pours a motor oily thick black with a light brown head. Incredibly beautiful aroma of potting soil, roasty coffee and piney US hops. Taste has big notes of coffee and coffee, chocolate, earthiness, roasted malt, hops, some dark fruit and rum; awesome. Very full, round and creamy on the palate; seriously - the body on this beer HAS to be the silkiest thing on the planet. The great roastyness lingers forever. I have had this beer on four separate occasions over the past couple years; (full bottles) it never ceases to amaze. Perfection. ",99.947,thepaleale,Michigan,8.3%,Founders Breakfast Stout
