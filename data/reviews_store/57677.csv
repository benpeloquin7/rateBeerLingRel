The beer had a flat pour with minimal cream white head. The beer had a lovely amber color. The beer had a very sweet malty flavor with a creamy soft, almost flat, mouth feel with limited hop flavor. A decent beer, went well enough with Rhode Island clam chowder. Having had the beer in the bottle in was much worse on tap. There is a much more distinctive and noticeable hop flavor from the bottle.  ",43.134,submart,Vermont,4.6%,Long Trail Ale
