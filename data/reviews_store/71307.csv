The roasted malt belies the fact that this is a bock bier. Now, Im not a fan of roasted flavours but this is offset by the winterberry taste so its makes for above average drinking. Is it my favorite beer as a hophead? No, of course not. However, it is a nice change from the standard ubersweet bock. Come to think of it, its also a change from the average stout with all that roasted malt in it... Technically a good hybrid beer, jus not in my taste range.
