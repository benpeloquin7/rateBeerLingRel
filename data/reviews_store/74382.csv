Pours a nice amber to caramel color, hazy with a medium yellowish head and plenty of lacing. Aroma was fruity floral mixture of hops with a spicy bite to it. Taste starts with a refreshing fruity, sweet, tart flavor and finished with a clingy bitter hop flavor that I enjoyed. Overall a solid beer that I would buy again.
