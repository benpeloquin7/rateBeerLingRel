Off the bat, very strong tropical and fruity aromas with a hint of alcohol, very pleasant. Tastes just as good, slight alcohol note but nothing bothersome, still very fruity. The beer had some coagulated proteins and resins sitting at the bottom but had very little impact on the flavor. ",92.602,dgrp,Canada,9%,Kruhnen Draconic Transylvanian Pale Ale

Faint smell of chocolate and roasted malts. Definitely holds a moka taste with a slightly boozy kick to it. Although its a sweet stout, the sweetness fatigues my palate a bit too easily and makes it hard to enjoy a entire bottle of it. 

Its an easily available beer in Montreal and on the cheaper side, I definitely suggest to try it out with friends. ",90.407,dgrp,Canada,6.5%,Brasseurs du Monde Gamme Connaisseur LExploit

This Double IPA is currently my favorite to date. Drinking such a tasty beer from a can engulfs you with constant hits of citrusy, earthy and floral American hop flavors and aromas.

The key to this beer is definitely ""balance."" All hops up front without being fussy or annoying in a very easy to drink package. Unfortunately it was so easy to drink I realized Ive drank half of the can in no time. 

Heady Topper to me is a celebration of craft beers, a quality beer that has taste and aroma that should be drank and enjoyed as much as possible rather than be seen as a mystical beast.
