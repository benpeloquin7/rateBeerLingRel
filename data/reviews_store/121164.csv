About a finger of head that leaves good lacing. Strong smell of lemon, with a touch of pepper. Taste is very light with strong lemon, clove, and pepper. Finishes with a sweet earthy-citrus note. Medium mouthfeel that fits the saison style perfectly. Has a nice tart finish.

Overall, One of the best saisons Ive enjoyed. The citrus is perfectly balanced with the clove and pepper to make a truly enjoyable beer. ",90.407,miamj24,Idaho,7.5%,Grand Teton The Grand Saison

Aroma is a combination of fruit, pale malt, and coriander. Compliments the color perfectly. Taste begins sweet with malt and fruit, and transitions into a bit of alcohol and spice. Finishes nicely with coriander. One of my favorite beers. Very refreshing on a warm day, and the varied, yet balanced, flavoring works well. ",95.789,miamj24,California,10%,AleSmith Horny Devil

Appearance is dark brown with about a half inch tan head. The head fades quickly, leaving only a trace amount of lacing. Aroma is of strong dark fruit as well as notes of caramel and fig. The aroma is varied, yet well balanced. The taste is exceptional. Balanced wonderfully with dark fruit and malt present at the beginning, fading to a slight amount of alcohol and a touch of spice. Overall, a delicious quad that Im excited to try aged. Very smooth and balanced, with the distinct flavors evident with every sip. ",99.947,miamj24,Belgium,10%,Struise Pannepot
