Kind of a very weak watery taste, not full bodied, with some strange bitter finish. Not impressed, as Ive had very high hopes for the Bohemia Regent brand (their President beer is in a totally another league for me, but on the good side).

This could very well be my worst dark beer I have ever drinked. Definitely not worth to be called a premium beer I think. ",49.947,audiocricket,Czech Republic,4.4%,Bohemia Regent Tmav Lek 12
