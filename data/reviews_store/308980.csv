Not the best Kernel brew that Ive had but by no means a bad beer. Ive seen quite a few reviews here that have portrayed the beer more negatively than I think is fair - but it all comes down to personal preference I suppose. This beer does have a sickly sweetness to it and there are a lot of sweet fruits that yu pick up in both the aroma and taste (mangos, strawberries, etc.) but this beer is still a great IPA for an English brew..better than anything English that you could pick off the shelf at Tesco, put it that way! Not much carbonation at all which adds to that thick sweet and sickly taste..but a pretty awesome Double IPA in my books and well worth a chug!

Not a huge fan of brown ales but theres so much to this beer in both the aroma and the taste. The aroma is super complex with a variety of malts used, giving off milk chocolate, caramel, and peanut scents with a floral hop character coming through. Jumping to the taste of the beer, roasted malts come through thick and fast and the taste pretty much follows the aroma with the hop bitterness coming in right at the back of the mouth after your mouth is washed with the roast malts, milk chocolate, peanut, and caramel flavours.

This beer is something like youd expect to find if youd just walked along a palm edged street in California and stopped off at the nearest Tony Romas bar and grill...it really does ooze that Californian, west coast style. The taste is big on grapefruit and citrus, and oozes that great fruity bitterness.

Breweries like Kernel are so exciting for the UK craft brewing scene because they are offering us beers that we would only find the likes of in the USA and thats a great thing in the current beer climate because the US breweries are really brewing superb stuff.

If youve read some of my other reviews youll know that I dont like to go into too much detail as most of the time other reviewers have done that job for me..so let me just say that this beer really is worth seeking out as it does sit firmly (in my belief) as one of the very best stouts in the world.

Dont get me wrong the beer starts well, and ends fairly crisp and pleasant, but somewhere in the middle its a little confused and pungent and I cant shake a strange rotten taste coming through.
