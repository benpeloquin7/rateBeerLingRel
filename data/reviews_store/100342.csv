Aroma: lightly roasted malt flavour with slight bready overtones. Hops are a well pronounced mixture of grassy and floral notes intermingling with a very slight Doughy taste and detectable alcohol which gives way to the impression the beer is around5%(though I dont know this)

Judging by the velvety texture, beer is almost certainly nitrogenated which also ensures the head is maintained leaving nice lacing as you drink.

As stated, beer has a velvety texture and a pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. 

visually, beer is a gold colour with good liveliness and at 200Ft. certainly quaffable. ",,Olipro,Hungary,,Wiking Sr

Appearance is typical for a pale lager - golden colour with decent liveliness, head tends to dissipate rapidly if you have a glass that doesnt cause much fizzing, still manages to leave some lacing.

Taste varies by how cold it is and how its served, can is not recommended, Bottle and Draught is far better. At warmer temperatures, the aroma mingles with the taste more - sweetness is light to medium, same for the bitterness. Definitely not terribly complex but well-suited for a session, easy-drinking.

Body is fairly light with a thin texture and lively to average carbonation with a lightly bitter finish, if served at room temp, beer is surprisingly devoid of the typical unpleasant astringent aftertaste and is in fact tolerable, though drinking it at room temp isnt recommended.

Final verdict? perfect for what it is - I.E. an easy-drinking lager that wont have you going home on your hands an knees after 5 pints. ",2.646,Olipro,Hungary,4.5%,Arany szok
