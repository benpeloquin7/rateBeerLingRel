The taste is also very metallic. Long lingering aftertaste finally reveals the malt  presence with oaky vanilla and some red fruit flavors. Somewhat vinous, with a hint of oxidation like old wet cardboard. Deep, inviting  ruby color with an off white thin head. Mouthfeel is pretty light for the style, due to high carbonation.
much better as it warms, Id drink this at nearly room temperature (about 60 degrees F) ",94.47,jlonghairdc,England,6%,Greene King Strong Suffolk (Olde Suffolk)
