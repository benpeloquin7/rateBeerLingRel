Thats a great name, fits the beer well but it could be called; W.W.A.A.B., for Wow What A Awesome Beer!

It has to be the oatmeal that makes this extremely smooth for a Russian Imperial Stout. This is the easiest drinking Russian Stout Ive ever had. BORIS has a 9.4% alc/vol so the easy drink ability could call for a warning label.

Boris is very dark like most Russian Imperials. Not flat like some, but not overly carbonated. An awesome roasted malt  chocolate flavor. I can not get over how smooth this beer is! The hops are not overwhelming. The brewer has done a great job in keeping them balanced with the malt!

Being a hop head this is not normally my beer of choice. This is the best beer Ive had in recent memory!!

Hoppin To Heaven India Pale Ale one of the best new ones Ive tried this year.

I will go back to buy more tomorrow. If I would have known it was this good I would have bought more.

Pours with a nice head. There is a nice color to the beer. There is not a overwhelming surge of hops when the beer first hits your tongue. The Hops ( Cascade/Columbus) then explode off the back of your tongue. This is a very good tasting IPA. The aroma is not a strong as some IPAs. Hoppin To Heaven India Pale Ale is a easy drinking IPA.
