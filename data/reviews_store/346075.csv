Some dark specks of particulate are visible after the bottle is poured.

My tongue is left a little confused. Definite chewiness and a silky texture.

Pours a clear, light cola-caramel shade, with moderate carbonation, and a creamy, smooth, well-retained head of light mocha that leaves curtains of lace. Aroma is a rich, dense, toasty maltiness, with dark wood, deep red berries, and cinnamon with brown sugar. The flavor presents interesting and delectable hints of whiskey aged in lightly charred oak amidst its softly sweet malt panorama, like a more restrained Innis & Gunn offering. Theres caramel and vanilla flourishes as well. Creamy texture and moderately chewy, with a gently lingering finish.

Pours a clear, bright light copper hue with active, moderate carbonation streams, and an off-white cap that retreats after holding strong for a few minutes, leaving a few bubbly lace webs and rings. The aroma immediately tantalizes, with hops presenting bright citrus and sweet berries, moderately strong, and somewhat like fruit punch. A moderate current of toasted malt weaves its way in between. The flavor sneaks in an unexpected bite of resinous bitterness, sandwiched with grapefruit and cherry, that happily settles back after the initial sips, and the warm toast of the malts coasts along in turn. A little bit thick, with a softly lingering bitter pine note. The overall impression suggests an India Session Ale, but with an added 0.5% punch above 5% abv. Like Red Racer ISA, a similarly configured favorite beer, this ale does a fine job of balancing maltiness and hoppiness in a eminently drinkable and enjoyable whole.

Pours a clear, dark yellow-amber shade, with moderate carbonation bubbling up in a pair of streams, and a crackling, pearly, briefly-lived white head - it looks rather ghetto. Aroma is a clean, mildly sweet cereal and malt melange - your basic decent pale lager profile. Then, surprisingly, the flavor dispenses with cereal sweetness almost altogether, for a dry, delicate, pilsner-like flavor and bitterness located almost exclusively at the front of the tongue - very interesting, not at all expected from a budget brand, and most definitely tasty and refreshing! Silky body, with a clean, dry finish, and just a brief hit of mild bitterness at the end. Wow, this stuff is damned good! Super-drinkable, and would be more than acceptable as a session or lawnmower quencher. It has a definite ""champagne beer"" character, and at low cost; that combination makes me a happy man. So far tonight, Ive found two ""buck-a-beers"" at Real Canadian that are solid winners and new favorites; I have a few more to go, and I hope good luck remains on my side...

Pours a clear, light orange-amber hue, with active streams of fine carbonation, and a quickly-vanishing pearly white head. Aroma is sweet, with bready malts, caramel, maple, and honey, and with an earthy, lightly spicy hop note. Flavor is much the same; a broad, mild, and doughy malt dominance and faintly bothersome syrupy sweetness. The spice on the nose doesnt come through on the tongue, which is a bit disappointing as it would have nicely counterbalanced the honey. Nicely creamy, chewy, and with a clean finish - no long-lasting sweetness to contend with. Its initially similar to Big Rocks River Valley Red Ale (in price, packaging, and initial appearance and aromas/flavors), but, by virtue of being a lager, its much more a close, cheap cousin to Sleemans Honey Brown. Nicely drinkable and enjoyable as a budget beer, with no deal-breaking flaws, but unless you have a taste for sweet brews like me, the syrupiness will very soon become cloying.

Pours a slightly orangey straw yellow with lots of very fine carbonation and a creamy white cap that crackles and vanishes with time to leave rings and islands of lace. Aroma is similar to many lagers, with unsweetened malty cereals, and hints of buttered corn that I truly dislike in the aroma and flavor of beer. (Actually, I dont know if my nose and tongue read this correctly as ""corn""; it just might be some version of biscuity or cracker-like malt.) Flavor is practically identical to most light lagers, right down to a stronger presence of the confusing and distasteful corn/biscuit flavor, with what seems to be a hint of herbal hops. Thin, and with a dry finish. I wouldnt go out of my way for this. Although labeled as a Kristallweizen, its indistinguishable from most adjunct lagers. So-so.

Pours a clear orange-amber hue with light, fine streams of carbonation and a puffy, solid white head that leaves zigzags of lace. My initial reaction to the aroma was ""wow, this smells the way I remember how beer smelled when I was a kid"", likely due to Canadians buying and consuming a goodly amount of domestic Vienna lager. Along with a solid, medium-dark malt punch is a minty, jasmine tea undercurrent, studded with dark berries; the flavor maintains the same profile, and is both gently flavorful and eminently quaffable. The slightest level of bitterness carries over briefly into a dry, clean finish. Perhaps Id be happier with stronger flavor components, but that would drive it into another style altogether, and, as it is, I could session the daylights out of this.

Pours a nearly opaque pumpkin-orangey brown, with a couple of visible, fine streaks of carbonation and a milky head that goes from creamy to pearly and leaves spots of lace in its wake. Aroma delivers a payload of bready malt with hints of caramel, while the hops bring deep red, winey fruits and an undercurrent of dusty herbalness. Flavor is gentle overall, focusing on its fruity, grapey, lightly sweet, vinous character on top of its toasted malts, with a touch of carbonic bite and alcohol warmth. A bit chewy with a slightly lingering finish. Subtly flavorful when it comes to its winey facets, never entering a distasteful malt liquor territory. Still, this beer puzzles me.
