It&apos;s screams for meat mimosa! The color is a dark cola that slides down the glass after a sip. Creamy light carbonation with a small head. Toasty nose of coconut, spice, capsicum and oak. .. Such a long finish! The length of this beer is impressive. It starts with curried coconut and finishes a caramel, herbaceous chili. Fantastic!

The sweet, lightly roasted, hoppy aromatics of the medium head show through to the deliciously crisp yet lightly creamy rich body. With the palate structure similar to a dense lager, this beer approaches with a crisp brightness at first then folds into a gentle malty fullness with slightly roasted sweetness and a fruity spicy finish with mellow hops. A genuine admiration for this ale develops among those who have tried it and love amber style ales. If I see this stuff at a BBQ I know that there must be cool people around.
