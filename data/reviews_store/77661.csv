Aroma was of slight roasted malts.  The flavor was acceptable, though not as strong as I had hoped.  There was some roasted maltiness in the flavor, but nothing overall stood out to me.  Had a clean, refreshing finish, but I was left wanting a little more.  This wasnt a bad beer, but there are much better dunkels out there. ",13.716,Paul150,Missouri,4.8%,Becks Dark

Overall, I found it similar to Pilsner Urquell, though I felt it had a more subtle flavor overall.  Poured a pale, clear golden color with a finger of head.  Has a spicy, hoppy aroma, but nothing too strong.  Slight malty flavor at the front gives way to a nice, sharp hop flavor towards the back of the tongue.  Leaves little aftertaste.  A very nice summer beer much like Urquell.  The Czechs have impressed me again. ",47.538,Paul150,Czech Republic,5%,Budweiser Budvar B:Original (Czechvar) 12

Has a slightly fruity, bready aroma and a medium head that dissipated relatively quickly.  An opaque, pale yellow from the fact it is unfiltered.  Had a sweet, bready taste, with just enough of a hint of citrus flavoring.  Finishes very cleanly; it had very little hop bitterness, though I dont expect this kind of beer to be very hoppy.

It was mostly of roasted malts and a slight coffee.  However, I was expecting a slightly stronger roasted taste.  Nothing was wrong with the taste, though.

Flavor was good for a light beer as this, especially since I am a fan of the darker beers.  There was enough of a hoppy taste to tell you are drinking a good beer, but not so much hops as to overpower the taste.  Overall a well-balanced taste.  The texture was a bit thin but smooth.

Given my previous experience with A-B products, I was leery of trying this, but since it was free I gave it a shot.  I have to say, I was impresses that there is an A-B product Id have again.  The appearance was a nice, solid black with a reasonably impressive head that lasted for most of the glass.  The smell seemed to be quite muted -- There wasnt much happening there besides some mild roasted smells.  I was impressed with the flavor, which had some chocolate and coffee taste to it.  The beer had a somewhat creamy texture with the head and carbonation, but overall it was a bit light for my tastes.  Still, I would rate this as perhaps the best A-B product Ive tried; maybe an upper middle class of beers Ive had.  If I had the choice, Id still order a Guinness over this, but I would drink it again. ",15.097,Paul150,Missouri,4.2%,Bare Knuckle Stout
