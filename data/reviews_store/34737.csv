I am not sure whose idea it was to add the ""sea-monkeys"" or whatever was floating in the bottle, but you might want to re-think that one!  I have tasted this beer on several occasions and be sure that it keeps you guessing as consistency isnt in the recipe.  Id like to recommend visiting the very expensive looking brewery and store but nothing new has been added in the past year or so.  Disappointed that there was nothing new to see or buy.  Too expensive  actually over priced for what you actually get  just like their Ale.  ",22.707,Iknowgreatbeer,Canada,5%,Robert Simpson Confederation Ale
