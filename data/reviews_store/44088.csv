It pours very, very thick - almost like syrup.  The head is almost non-existent and there really is no noticable carbonation.  This negatively impacted my experience, but only moderately.  The taste is diverse and explosive.  A strong coffee/caramel foundation with significant hints of raisin, plum pummeled the palate as a nice shot of hops helped finish off this robust beer at the finish.  My stomachs capacity for additional consumption was limited after just one of these.  I cant imagine sticking with this one throughout a festive evening.  Overall, a very good stout...
