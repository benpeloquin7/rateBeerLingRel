Almost looks black in dim light.

Smell: White chocolate, hint of licorice, floral hops give way to maly sweetness.

Taste: Very well balanced, big hops and chocolaty malt. Dry and biscuty on finish. Big, beautiful and rich.

Appearance: Poured into my New Belgium snifter. Pours almost black until you hold it up to the light. 1/2 inch tan/mocha head that stays the whole time. Medium to sparse lacing.

Overall: A very big, well balnced beer that refuses to be pigeonholed into a style or class (in my opinion) Great with German chocolate cake.

Smell: Very faint lemon, stale bread, very little smell

Appearance: Pours golden orange, white head that disapates quickly, No lacing, big popping bubbles

Taste: Tastes more like Fat Tire or Sam Adams Lager than an American IPA. However, it does have a faint citrus hop taste.

Mouthfeel: This is the strongpoint of this beer. Rich full bodided carbonation gives way to smokey creamy swallow. This beer awesome with a good old homemade sandwich.

Pure white cramy 1/2 inch head. Light orange in color. Killer lacing.

Smell: Citrus, caramel, pinecone, dried apricot

Taste: Citrusy hops, extremely faint anise, very small yeast sourness at finish but overall citrus bitterness. Beautiful.

Mouthfeel: Dry, creamy bottle conditioned carbonation, effervescent on the tongue. Creamy foam on the cheeks at the finish. Piney citrus sticks with you.

Overall: A lovely hybrid of a Belgian golden ale and an American IPA. A match make in beer heaven.
