This beer is great combination of roasted malts and intense hops. Pours an extremely dark chocolate brown with a slight bit a maroon showing up on the edges with a thin light tan head. The aromas scream IPA with intense citrus notes like grapefruit and fresh sliced oranges. You do pick up slight notes of roasted malts on the nose but it is tough to get through all the citrus. At first sip I really noticed the hops but as time progressed and the beer warmed the sweet and toasty flavors grain began to come through and actually becomes extremely well balanced. Overall this is a great beer for IPA lovers or anybody that wants to try something new.
