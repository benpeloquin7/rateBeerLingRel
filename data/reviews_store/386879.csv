The price, however, is not, but I guess youve gotta pay for the goodies. The aroma feels strong and dark, just like the color. Without any excessive light, it seems true black, but under more intensive oservation its actually more like brown. The class is covered in stains almost completely. Just awesome! The taste feels like coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit of hoppy sweetness. Worth its price. ",90.629,Flamel0,Poland,6.2%,Kraftwerk Parabellum
