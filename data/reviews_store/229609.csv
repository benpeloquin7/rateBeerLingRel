That said. This is probably one of the best bottles of beer Ive ever sat down and enjoyed. Dark, creamy, malty, sweet, fruity, rich, the healthy ABV sneaks up and reminds you its a winter warmer not a tailgater, but soooo smooth for a serious winter  beer. Made me want to go out and buy a Heath bar. So rich and decadent, theres a good reason its sold in 4 packs ",83.679,hockeyhoser81,Massachusetts,9.5%,Samuel Adams Imperial Series Double Bock
