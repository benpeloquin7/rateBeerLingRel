Does not assert itself with any dominant or overbearing flavors, but everything comes together nicely. Good balance of bittering vs. aroma hops. Finishes nice, clean, mildly diluted. Differentiates itself within the Black IPA style but does not come close to Wookey Jack, which is the gold standard in my opinion. ",98.993,pjames317,Maine,7.2%,Maine Beer Weez

Ostensibly an amber ale that reveals itself to be more of a honey gold when held to direct light. Some nice pillowy head with early signs of sticky lacing. Aroma is fruit forward, with a nod to mango, ripe pear, strawberry, golden raisins and honeydew. Definitely has a certain freshness quality with a malt backbone that is present and desperately trying to assert itself amid the dominant hop profile. Pleasantly bitter with onslaught of resinous, citric hops. Exemplary West Coast IPA. ",98.19,pjames317,Oregon,6.4%,Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA

Interesting concept of a beer. German malt, booze-soaked raisins, sour dough bread, and floral hop bouquet. Very well balanced. Has a burnt, chewy quality to the mouthfeel. Nice bitterness. Crisp lager carbonation gives way to flavorful hop profile that finishes bitter and dry. Great change of pace from the typical IPA. Recommended.
