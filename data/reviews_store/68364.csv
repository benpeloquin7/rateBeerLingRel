An aroma of blood and steel overwhelm the senses... The color is an unsettling orange (the taste, aroma and color are probably imparted by rusty fermenting tanks)...

Furthermore what is with the name?!  Pennsylvania has many quality craft breweries!!! this beer defiles our state and its brewing tradition! ",2.206,collegebeer,Wisconsin,5%,Pennsylvania Style Ice Beer
