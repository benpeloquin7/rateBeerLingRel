Its not bad, just doesnt live up to the Berliner Weiss style for me. Its got a nice hazy golden color with a light white foam. The nose has some banana, yeast and a hint of sourness. The taste is more of the same with some tropical fruit, German wheat sweetness, and a hint of tartness or sourness. Not much finish to be had. Id probably try it again to make sure Im not having an off day. It would still be a good summer beer on a hot day. ",39.104,porknwhiskey,California,4.5%,Lightning Sauerstrom Ale
