Lemon (peel), pineapple & pines. Long lasting aftertaste, but moderate bitterness (for an IPA). I took this one by recommendation in Leipzigs Beer Freunde and it was a very nice surprise. Shame I wouldnt be able to drink it more often - Ill have to comfort myself in Thornbridges Halcyon and BrewDogs JackHammer, similar in attributes (although lower on bitterness), but also in quality.
