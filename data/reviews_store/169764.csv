The head holds moderately leaving a low level of lace.  The beer looks thick.  Banana and clove in the aroma.  Both are distinctive and arrive on in a different place as opposed to combining.  The banana is stronger and one has to work a bit to get the clove, but it is not insignificant.  The flavors are more balanced than the aroma.  Clove and banana compete for attention with lemon playing a supporting role.  Alcohol is present and adds to complexity and balance.  There are even light hops accenting the lemon.  This has good carbonation and is thick in body.  An excellent example of the style and a true German from America. ",,Jayh,Indiana,5.9%,Oaken Barrel King Rudi
