Welcome back to the 80s. If you rate it as a beer its gets zeros across the board. Little taste, watery texture, flat as a tac and generally all round terrible. But you know what? Sometimes after a long day at work a terrible melbourne hits the spot. When you need that brainless beer its perfect. Theres no need to complicate simplicity like Melbourne. You know its beer (just) but when youre brain dead and need a drink then why waste a good beer? Just smash it down and stop worrying about life. It holds a special place in my liver and probably will forever.  ",1.471,Caravan,Australia,4.6%,Melbourne Bitter
