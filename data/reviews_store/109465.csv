Sweetness at first then goes into way more complexity. Obviously, not your typical brown ale...really shouldnt be classified as one. A great beer if youre looking for a strong ale for a quick effect...Not really a beer to drink multiples of at one time. ",99.259,MikeyMalts,Delaware,12%,Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron

Poured into tulip glass. Pours a deep dark brown/black with a tan head which dissipated quickly. Aroma has doughy sweet malts, coffee, molasses, chocolate, and hazelnuts...roasty and toasty! Taste has that great sweetness in oatmeal stouts...more complexity arrives as you drink. A nice mellow smokiness is present which balances well with the roasted dark coffee feel. A great suggestion for a one beer sitting and even more.  ",94.716,MikeyMalts,California,5.8%,Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout

Poured into tulip glass. Pours an amber brown color with a very lively frothy tan head. Aroma is a sour one with citrus hovering about...some spiciness from the cinnamon...light banana, chocolate, toasty notes as well. Taste is heavy on the sour and mellows out to reveal a hint of that cocoa flavor. Abundant carbonation all over...could see how the sourness might weigh a palate down. This beer drinks more like a saison to me...Well not really what I expected from this one, not disappointed, but not ecstatic about it either. I prob wont buy it again since Ive had it now. Great buy for the sour lovers though, I just expected and wanted more of that ""cacao"" taste. ",97.207,MikeyMalts,Michigan,7.5%,Jolly Pumpkin Maracaibo Especial
