Orion beer is only good in Okinawa, served with fresh sushi.  The Orion bottles I have had in the U.S. taste as though they have been heated and cooled a few times.  On Okinawa, the brewery is no further than 2 1/2 hours away from every izakaya pub and restaurant. When it is fresh and cold it is an enjoyable beer for the unbearable Okinawan heat! Kampai!
