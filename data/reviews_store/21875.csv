It will only be availible this summer at select bars in the atlanta area and at most package stores that carry most of sweetwaters brews.  This beer is definatly a keeper, a good ""porch beer"".  Intense crisp cirus flavor thoughout.  Gos down sooooo easy.       ",70.297,JeffH311,Georgia,5.1%,Sweetwater Hummer
