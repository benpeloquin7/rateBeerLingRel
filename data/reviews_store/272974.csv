Taste is initially very balanced, with a nice malt and caramel baseline, and a hoppy flavour takes over with piney and lightly grapefruity notes, ending in a noticeable but not overpowering bitterness. Pretty straightforward Ipa, but that doesnt make it less drinkable. Will get again.  ",97.538,Sappy113,California,7%,Ballast Point Big Eye IPA

Very nice aroma of fruity hoppiness, dominated by peaches and citrus. Aroma couldve been even more intense without losing any appeal at all, because its really enticing. Flavour is again sweetly citrusy, slightly floral and combined with the thinninsh texture makes for a very easily drinkable beer. Recommended, especially if youre looking for a refreshing beer for summertime or just to wind down without feeling like a complex assault on your palate.

Dark, golden colour with slight head, leaving some nice lacing in the glass. Classic aroma: fresh and fruity with notes of peaches and grapefruit, but not very overwhelming. Slight caramel there too. Flavour follows suit, nothing complex, but thats not a bad thing, it feels just right for the style. Really refreshing and crisp, nice bready malt backbone too, but without being the dominate Flavour at all. Bit of bitterness at the end, just to tickle the mouth a bit. Really nice.
