Once I saw Brian update the BP facebook page and tapped this, I had to try it out. It pours very dark with a wonderful medium chocolate head that seemed to last forever. The aroma has a tremendous amount of chocolate, some vanilla, and some noticeable rum as well as a nice alcohol burn at the back of your sinus. The first sip was all head, and WOW. The head itself is tastier than a lot of beers. The initial flavour has a dry roastiness. As it sits on the tongue the roastiness amplifies and the chocolate becomes apparent. At this time you notice an interesting dry powdery texture. Bitterness slowly intensifies complelementing the chocolate. Rum starts to become noticeable. As the brew passes, allowing the tongue to breathe, the rum flavour quickly escalates and brings with it that alcohol flavour, as well as a nice warming sensation in the chest. As quickly as the rum flavour reveals itself, it fades. Rich chocolate persists into the finish with, notes of vanilla, and light roast. This is ridiculously delicious.

Aroma is complex. Cedar and citrus up front. The citrus is a mixture of grapes and sour fruits. As your nose becomes accustomed to the initial intense bouquets, yeast and more subtle woody notes of the cedar become evident. As the brew comes in contact with the tongue, the yeast is the first to make its appearance, and quite intensely as well. The yeast flavour develops a little more as it sits on the tongue, giving it somewhat of a mild cheesiness. As you allow the beer to pass the tongue, all the flavours intensify and come together for that split moment where the tongue breathes. Citrus makes its first appearance, cedar also becomes more evident, and the yeastiness explodes along with a good amount of spices. This is the best moment in all good beers where all the flavours explode and join in harmony, and this beer is no exception. Soon after this beautiful moment, the yeast begins to become dominant again, overpowering the citrus and cedar. In the finish we return back to our initial, intensely yeasty, flavour with some slight hints of citrus. As the brew becomes warmer the finish becomes more and more spicier.
It fills me with glee to finally be able to taste a Russian River beer after hearing so much about them amongst my friends back in Tennessee. This beer has definitely lived up to my expectations.

As I allow the brew intimate contact with my taste buds I undergo what I like to call a ""tastegasm."" The oak and espresso notes are instantly apparent. Chocolate and hints of vanilla follow closely. At a cooler temperature the hops take center stage as the brew passes the tongue. Espresso and dark chocolate hardly stand up to the bite and bitterness and really makes this one-sided. But as the brew warms, the hops steps back and allows for more complexity. Hops now become complementary to the brash flavours of the espresso while the espresso complements the nice rounded flavours of the chocolate truffle. The espresso also tastes a little more roasty the warmer this gets. The bitterness persists throughout the finish. Chocolate is the first to fade with coffee barely lingering on.

The aroma is very malty with strong hints of bourbon, wood, and some light smokiness. The initial flavour is of oak with some whiskey, cocoa, and some smoky notes. As the brew sits on the tongue, the whiskey notes strengthen along with the smoke and cocoa, but doesnt become overpoweringly strong. Its well-rounded. Molasses creates some light sweetness. Vanilla starts to emerge. As the brew passes, the whiskey flavours strengthen even more bringing the vanilla with it. A light bitterness strikes emphasizing the more abrasive qualities of unsweetened cocoa and thus subduing the molasses sweetness. Smoky notes become slightly more apparent and brings more of the oak to light. The finish is smooth with the bitterness suppressed, but still noticeable and rather long-lasting. Malt is very prominent with bourbon and vanilla following close behind. Molasses becomes more apparent and highlights the smoother qualities of the cocoa. One thing I dont mention in this review up until now is the coffee flavour. The reason is that while the other flavours fluctuate during the experience, the coffee flavour stays constant. Its very noticeable but not at all overpowering. And towards the very finish, while the other flavours fade, coffee persists.This is very, very good.

Paired with a Wenslydale (with Cranberries) cheese. 
The cheese: It is mildly sweet and initially creamy, but becomes dry towards its finish. The cranberries are almost too overpowering, though, as there are quite a bit of cranberries in this cheese. However, consuming the cheese itself, it has the perfect amount of cranberry flavour.
The pairing: As expected, the cranberries pair well with the citrus flavours of the beer. The flavour of the cheese is too mild to affect the flavour of the beer save for slightly accentuating the sweetness of the beer. But its the texture of the cheese thats the magic of this pairing. The initial mouthfeel of the beer becomes smoother as the finish no longer becomes dry. The hops in the finish is now masked with the creaminess of the cheese which also extends the smoothness of the beer into the finish.

Spices fade slightly to introduce some grain flavours. Hops and a semi-metalic bitterness increases a little as well, complementing the spices. The finish is also dry... very dry.Im not a huge fan of spices. But this creates some interesting layering effects between the spice/floral and the fruit/honey flavours that I find rather neat and intriguing... and not to mention the aroma...

As the brew passes the tongue, raisins and nuts manifest as the dry baked pumpkin/carrot bread erupts. Hopsy bitterness amplifies the dryness and well complements the other flavours.

There is a good amount of grapefruit, orange, and lemon citrus with strong rounded notes of a sweet caramel. Pine is prevalent but not overpowering. There is some grass and some subtler dry resin notes. The flavour is an intense blast of hops. I feel like Im chewing on hops. Citrus flavours arent as dominant as their aromas. The resin notes, however, are more widespread. Pine is evident, but, like the aroma, not overpowering. For a few seconds before your palate is overwhelmed by an explosion of bitterness, you can taste the round caramel flavour. Though, quickly after, the bitterness hits hard and lasts into the finish. The finish is dry and extremely bitter. Resin notes prevail through the finish as citrus continue to be more subtle.

The initial flavour is dominant in blueberries, but not overpowering. Its graciously assertive. The front of the palate enjoys the nice, mellow blueberries as the centre starts to notice some more of the mildly smoked woody notes. The back of the palate, however, is assaulted with a bitter dark chocolate. As the smoked flavours increase, it quickly gravitates towards the back of the palate making the bitterness escalate. The blueberries are the first to fade. Smoke fades quickly as the bitterness overcomes it. The bitterness at the back of the tongue lasts for a long time. As the astringency fades, the wood notes prevail. Subtle cocoa and even more subtle blueberry is a nice addition to this somewhat dry finish. This is such a unique experience. Because its assault to the back of the palate, I feel to thoroughly enjoy it, one must give each sip some time for the palate to reset itself. Now, from my previous experiences of this beer (which were more fresh), I hardly remember the astringency towards the back of the palate, and the blueberries were definitely much more intense.

The fruit aroma is like a mix of a kiwi tart and a plum and pomegranate tanginess. It has a medium weight in the mouth with some decent carbonation. The flavour starts with a round dark fruit flavour (leaning more towards pomegranate). The smokiness then quickly overpowers the citrus. Hints of a brown sugary sweetness mellows out the medium bitterness. Towards the finish, dark fruit and soy sauce-like flavours are apparent behind the intensely dominant meaty smokiness. This is so incredibly smoky. Its like drinking meat. ",97.756,BossHossBikes,Michigan,7%,Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout

Bottled on 11/26/07. Pours a clear golden orange with a pale beige head. The aroma is prevalent in spices with some notes of a citrus tang. Im not that well-versed in spice aromas, but I can say that this reminds me of an overly-spiced pumpkin pie. The flavour is much like the aroma, lots of spices but not intense enough to make this a chore to drink. The fruit flavours, which resemble pears and orange rinds, give a balanced roundness to the spices. The finish has a light spiced bitterness, but is pretty smooth for the most part. Lots of yeastiness in the finish too. I dont like spiced beers, but this isnt too bad. My first experience with this beer, though, wasnt an enjoyable one. I cracked one open shortly after my Dark Lord Day road trip. The spices were overbearing. I think aging this, much like other spiced beers Ive had, really balanced out the flavour.

Pours a deep translucent dirty copper with a dark beige, quickly diminishing head. The aroma has a ton of barley with lots of sweet honey and some subtle notes of darker fruit . Alcohol is noticeable in the nose as well. The flavour is initially has lots of honey and caramel, and very sweet. Roasted nuts add a nice complement. The alcohol, however, becomes slightly overwhelming. Towards the finish, the roasty, nutty notes become slightly more dominant as the alcohol flavour fades. Honey follows closely in intensity. This is much more like a barley wine than a belgian strong ale, in my opinion. Its too sweet for my tastes, like many other barley wines. Its not much towards my interests, but its tasteful for a barley wine style. The honey sweetness is a nice touch, and I like the roasted nuttiness.

Pours pitch black with an extremely dark dan head. The aroma has lots of a dark fruit tang mixed in with roasty, smokiness. Oatmeal as well as bitter cocoa and hints of coffee is also noticeable in the aroma. I was a little bit surprised at how light the brew felt to the tongue. It also has a little bit of oiliness to it that is best attributed to coffee oils. The initial flavour is mildly sweet of darker fruits combined with some chocolate. Shortly after, though, a light bitterness grabs the tongue as the cocoa and roastiness begin to burst. The tangy dark fruits continue to be quite noticeable. It isnt until the dark fruit flavours start to diminish when the oatmeal begins to surface. Towards the finish, the dark fruit merely becomes a shadow as oatmeal becomes dominant. Cocoa, light coffee, and roasty flavours merely complement the oatmeal. There is a slightly noticeable bitterness in the finish as well. This is very tasty and theres a lot going on in the flavour.

The aroma is huge in sweet caramel and brown sugar. Tons of woody, oak notes as well. Strong raisin and plums accompanies a more subtle but noticeable warm alcohol aroma. Its very viscous to the tongue and quite sweet. The caramel that was in the aroma is still quite strong in the flavour. Oak notes are way more noticeable, though, and creates a woody, dryness. Some dark fruit flavours tries to emerge through the intense caramelly sweetness and the woody oak. Alcohol is very, very prevalent in the finish and creates a warming sensation in the chest. The brew becomes lightly dry with the oak notes becoming more intense. Its still rather sweet, though. Thats really the only downfall of this, in my opinion. Its just a bit too sweet.

Pours a translucent golden yellow with bits of sediment floating around. Head is bubbly and white and quickly diminishes. The aroma... wow... Imperial Wheat Beer? Hops are so prevalent here. Lots of pine tons of white grapefruit. Wheat is somewhat distinguishable behind the intense hop aroma. The flavour is surprisingly very well balanced as opposed to the aroma. Pine isnt as strong in the flavour, though, grapefruit is still a dominant flavour. The wheat is more distinguishable. Subtle roastiness appears then fades almost instantly as the brew passes the tongue. Towards the finish, pine becomes a little more evident. The finish has some nice round, smooth citric notes thats well complemented with a bready dryness and a light bitterness. This is very thirst quenching.

Grain and some delicate dark fruit citrus flavours start to emerge. Though, the caramelly sweetness is still dominant. Towards the finish, alcohol becomes noticeable, but very subtly.
