A solid, but dry malt base that might benefit from the addition of a few more caramel malts to supply a little more sweetness and just a touch more of color.  Good use of Amarillo and Centennial hops, they go really well together.  Great head retention but does have a strange sediment that goes from bottle to glass even when carefully poured.

Definitely one of the best American pale ales from a east coast brewer.     ,94.408,cascadehop,Virginia,5.6%,New River Pale Ale
