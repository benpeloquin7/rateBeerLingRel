A nice thick white head forms on the pour.  Crystal clear with an orange/honey hue.  Super clear.  Head lasts and leaves plenty of lacing and legs.  Aroma is intense hops with both pine and grapefruit coming to the forefront.  Cascade and Amarillo are present.  Flavor is dominated by hops so much that I even though I know theres malt there, I have a hard time picking it up.  The honey malt provides some sweetness undertones.  Body is light and finish is extremely sharp and biting.   ",98.993,nocsimian,Colorado,9.7%,Avery Anniversary Twenty

Citrus notes very apparent in the aroma with a small hint of bubblegum and caramel.  Bitterness is well balanced against the malt bill while the aroma and finishing tastes let you know its an IPA.

Tough to gauge the bitterness with the coffee but it isnt cloying.  Probably the best coffee beer Ive had - will given even Oatmeal Breakfast Stout a run for its money.
