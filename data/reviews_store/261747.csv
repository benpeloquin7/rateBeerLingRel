This one pours amber (Big 6 I in Munchen pour golden); no head (Big 6 pour 3 finger head); and has the nosing and taste characteristics of Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, and Milwaukees best. I know Karbach can do better because I have tasted their other beer. Karbachtoberfest stands out as an adjunct filler beer.
