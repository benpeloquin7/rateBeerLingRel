Aroma is day old coffee grounds in that depressing tinted filter kind of way.  The flavor starts out sweet with strong flavors of Vanilla and coffee but finishes bitter with the nose winning over and coffee grounds filling dancing on the tongue with the strong carbonation.  Would enjoy more balance of vanilla and coffee with a stronger coffee rather than ground flavor.  Overall average. ,32.4,FirkinA,Michigan,4.5%,Atwater Vanilla Java Porter

Strong aroma of yeast, citrus and apricot... taste on the other hand has notes of grapefruit, apple and Zinc.  While this beer has an awesome scent and a pretty good taste, I was not as psyched as I had expected to be when pouring and sniffing.  The carbonation overpowers the mouthfeel... almost difficult to get a sense of this beer as it doesnt sit on the tongue very long... rather, dances around not leaving much of a footprint.  Overall enjoyable but wish it would settle a little more, perhaps at a warmer temp it would settle on the tongue but overall I am just not a big fan of big carbonation.

Well, if youve given into temptation and done a ""lipper"" of Bill then you are well on your way to a bad connotation drinking experience. 

 Like the Unplugged Apple Ale this Smoked Rye loses its head pretty quickly and leaves not a snail trail of lace behind.  The color however is a rich copper/burnt sienna(via Bob Ross)

As I mentioned, the aroma of this beer is straight ""Wild Bill"", with Rye and Smoke the expectation of strong smoke and caramel was anticipated but the plastic, acidic, smokey, sting was not.  The taste only expands on the aroma, and then some.  The Rye and Smoke combine in the mouth to cause a ripple effect of smoke and burnt toast... and plastic.  While my experience with this beer is definitely stained with the memory of long road trips and aching guts, this is definitely my least favorite of New Glarus offerings.
