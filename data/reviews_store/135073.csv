Wow. I was a little unsure as to how Id find this, with the ratings mentioning a heavy bourbon flavour, but its simply amazing. Pours a pitch black, very thick, like oil, has a very small, deep brown head which almost instantly dissipates, there are plenty of alcohol legs. Smell is obviously quite a lot of bourbon with chocolate and roasted malt notes, some alcohol is also present. Simply amazing tasting beer, there is a strong bourbon taste but its not overwhelming, its well balanced but very noticable. Theres also a big dark chocolate taste which coats your mouth, there is a strong roasted malt flavour too. It is quite sweet all ofver the tongue. Has a beautiful bourbon finish with some alcohol burn as it goes down, really warms your chest. Very thick and oily yet smooth, a beautiful mouthfeel.
