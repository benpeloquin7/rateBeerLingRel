Nice pour, thick rich head that lasts!Bigger nose than other wheats-hoppier, fruitier. Hazy golden brew. Full of flavor and zing on the tongue, yet virtually no aftertaste.

""Unfiltered"" means floaters! Head dissipates quickly. Subtle yeasty-citrusy aroma. I have this from bottle as often as from tap, but am rating a brew from the bottle.
