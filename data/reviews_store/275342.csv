Wow. Serious beer drinkers need to give this beer a try. Mazama is putting out some interesting stuff that many NW beer drinkers are unfamiliar with...or at least skeptical about. Im just not a Belgian or doppelbock guy, but this stop really surprised me. There is more taste here than I can describe. Its got...well...something. Its different. Its unique. Smooth and easy to drink, and pretty light for a 9.9%. Well, I guess technically it is a lager, but you wouldnt guess it without reading the label. 

 My only gripe is they wouldnt let me get a growler of it, and I would have gladly paid for it. Really curious to bring this one back home to Bend and see what my IPA friends think. They are selling it in bottles at the brewery, but that doesnt work for me. 

Anyway, if youre in Corvallis, find this brewery and try this beer. It will be worth the stop. Also try the Grand Crux. Between these two beers, Mazama has something unique for NW beer drinkers to talk about. ",63.158,cwald,Oregon,9.9%,Mazama Mazamanator
