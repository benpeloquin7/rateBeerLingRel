Pours a menacing pitch black color that actually sucks light in and wont release it. Less than one finger creamy tan yellow head that settles nicely on top of the beer. Aroma is pure goodness: Lightly roasty, chocolate, brandy, vanilla, wood, light smoke, ripe dark fruit, molasses, some hints of toffee and brown sugar. Flavor is about the same with a little more heat from the chilis and a little more brandy and booziness. Full body with a  boozy and malty finish. I think I still liked Bourbon Hunahpu best, but with some more time in the barrel, this beer would be even more spectacular.
