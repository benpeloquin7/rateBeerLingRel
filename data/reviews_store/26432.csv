Appearance can be sparkling,with a  tan foam head.  A nice caramel, woody aroma with a bitter-sweet taste, full body, thick feel, and a lively, long finish.  A great beer with foods, on the slopes, or for savoring after a long hard day.  If you can make it to Fort Collins it is worth it to take the New Belgium Beer tour...  A personal favorite.
