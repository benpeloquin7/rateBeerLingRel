08AUG12: They had the following Speedway Stouts available; Alesmith Speedway, Stout, Alesmith Speedway Stout Brewers Blend Barrel Aged, Alesmith Speedway Stout Vietnamese Coffee Brewers Blend Barrel Aged, Alesmith Speedway Stout Vietnamese Coffee.
Alesmiths Speedway Stout Brewers Blend Barrel Aged was by far my favorite. The only significant difference that I could detect between the VCBBBA and the BBBA was sweetness, especially on the finish.
I could go play by play, but for those of you who frequent Alesmith, this is your typical Speedway Stout in every dimension with the perfect barrel aged complexity on the aroma, taste, and finish. If you are a Speedway Stout fan and have not yet had this blend, I feel sorry for you.
Verdict? Unrivaled. ",99.841,chrisxmartin,California,12.5%,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Brewers Blend
