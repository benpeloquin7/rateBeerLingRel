Fruity notes dominate with orange, tangerines, grapefruit, pommegranate, peach, papaya, raspberry, strawberry marmalade and overripe mango. Grainy hints and molasses come to the fore transitioning into some greener touches of resin and grass. Delightful. Taste is sweet, sticky and punchy with alcohol. Massive intensity, the 750ml are too much for a single person. Maybe too much for two.

Big body, full mouthfeel. Smooth texture, low to mid carbonation. Long finish and really sticky aftertaste. Intense and powerful Barley Wine... but overly sweet. Youll love it if you drink just one little 50ml sample, but if you drink the equivalent to a normal bottle (330ml or 12 fl.oz.) the sweetness will be too much.

Pours a clear yellow color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly and leaves a small lacing. Aroma is weakly malty with almost no hop presence. Vaguely bready and grainy, weak, neutral with some evanescent floral hints. Not offensive, but really dull. Taste is quite watery and neutral as well. Almost no bitterness, bready and grainy. Dull. Inoffensive. Light bodied, mid-high carbonation. Refreshing and crisp. I really do not feel tempted to give this one higher scores. A great brewery making a dull beer where theres nothing to appreciate really. Its not just a style problem, since Schlenkerla Helles is a wonderful rendition of it.

Coffee-dominated notes, rough Arabica coffee-grains, coffee-cherries, toasted coffee, with coffee-liquor and smaller hints of bitter chocolate, truffles, figs and prunes. Some phenols come through although not in a disturbing way. Taste is coffee dominated but with much stronger presence of dark fruits, especially blueberries, plums, prunes and figs. Nice, strong finish and aftertaste. Unfortunately, the mouthfeel is a little bit dull. Light body, a bit watery which makes alcohol much more noticeable. Its not just warming, its felt on other levels too. ""Chocolate Quad"" my ass. It is nowhere near in mouthfeel to a Quad. This would be the downside but in general I still like it.

Not really bad, but I did not get much ""Ale"" character. Taste is mildly sour, with no sweetness and clear salty presence especially in the very dry finish. Flavors again remind of cider and Champagne with some tart apples and decent funkiness. OK. But lacks character.

Aroma is earthy, woody and mossy, with notes of overripe peach, goldenberry, bitter orange, grapefruit, mango and rosehip. A little bit messy and quite diluted with some pervasive phenolic hints. It might be a bad bottle though it says bbd: Feb 2017. Taste is moderately bitter with some accompanying tartness. Fruity flavors dominate with even semi-sweet touches. Tropical and overripe fruits, oranges and even tart apples with a continuing earthy aura. Clearly not in the best shape or maybe a bad batch. Medium body, soft carbonation.

Intense fruity notes of pineapple, mango, peach and melon start right away but vanish after a few minutes. With warming, an even stronger nose of hay, goldenberry and most of all pungent resin and pine become the dominant feature. Begins like a well-hopped Barley Wine but becomes more IIPA later. Nice! Taste is well-balanced with initial sweet fruity malts and more bitter middle and finish. Very flavorful with notes of tropical fruits and later pungent resinous touches. The powerful fruity bitterness is exacerbated by bits of alcohol. Again, a fine taste. Body is medium to big with a soft to medium carbonation and an overall oily texture. Some nice alcohol warming.
