Great typical baking spices on the nose. Big full-bodied brew though does not show the alcohol as much as expected. Pumpkin flavor is not overpowering but complements the rest of the this blend well. Long, mildly bitter finish heavy on dark malts with a light hoppiness. This was a fun one to try.  ",86.176,awkwardPause,Utah,11%,Uinta Crooked Line Jacked B Nimble

Attractive pour - orange with creamy one-finger head. Very dank nose with fruity undertones. Medium body and extremely flavorful with long but pleasant bitter finish. Citrus and pine trees, sticky. This has way more going on than most pales. Great example of NW pale and would compare to recent efforts from Pfriem brewing (IPA).
