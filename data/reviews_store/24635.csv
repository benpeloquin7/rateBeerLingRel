Colt 45 in its Philippine incarnation (the only widely available ""import"" here, though it is actually brewed under license by San Miguel) is one of the worst beers you will ever have, unless of course you drink the other offerings by San Miguel brewery, then it is about par for the course... I had avoided Colt 45 my entire beer drinking life while growing up in North America because of the reputation for being a horrible cheap way to get drunk... It just seems like pure torture to do it this way, when half decent vodka goes for 20 buck for a half gallon, but I digress....Anyway, back to the beer, the fellows that gave it a 5 do so in jest. This could be one of the worst beers made in North America. In the true spirit of King Cobra, Mickeys Big Mouth, and Old English, this is a crappy beer targeting the poor communities. Dont try this beer to see how bad it can be. Have a Budweiser or a Miller High Life to sample a ""bad"" beer. This is s stretch to even call this ""beer"", and will make the above two examples seem delicious. Avoid, unless served at 32.5 degrees F at a stupid college frat party. Make sure to have someone dial 9-1 and then keep their finger on the last 1. The smell of this beer will be familiar to anyone in the paint thinner business. The alcohol taste is weird and strong, considering this is only a 6% beer. Avoid at all costs. ",0.294,woknblues,California,5.6%,Colt 45

Still, its a bad beer, full stop. The bottle is clear, I think the inherant skunkiness might have fought the Pee smell and won on some strange bacterial level.
