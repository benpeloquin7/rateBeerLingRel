Well, my first try of the NEW Ruination.
Being a long time fan of this brew I had to seek this one out fresh. Stone increased the malt bill to bring this up to 8.2% from 7.7% apv and subtlety changed the bittering hops. This IS still a hop bomb for sure. Same minimal white head and great lacing. The aroma is big citrus and a little piney. Taste is bitter grapefruit and lemon zest with a little pine and a nice smooth malty sweetness that, tastes way better balanced to me.
And just when you thought it was over, the hops come back with a vengeance.
A true ride for the tastebuds! Well tweaked Stone! ",99.736,NeZZeN,California,8.2%,Stone Ruination IPA

Aroma, a huge orange citrus and some fresh cut grass.
Taste is citrusy orange / grapefruit with a finish of resinous hops.
The mouthfeel is silky and finishes with a nice bitter hoppiness bite. Wonderful IPA. Definitely on my buy again list. ",98.833,NeZZeN,Florida,7.5%,Cigar City Jai Alai India Pale Ale

Almost no head that quickly falls to nothing and relatively no lacing.
Now the taste is really intriguing, with lots of sweet rye malt with a little of the port and oak. Moderate carbonation with some warmth and a bit of alcohol through the nose.
The feel is smooth and a little prickly from the carbonation....very nice as it warms.
Overall a very good cold evening brew.
Nice.

I always loved pumpkin pie and coffee together. This ale really hits the mark.
Aroma... Nutmeg, cinnamon, just like the pie
Appearance...Opaque black (if there is such a thing). Nice fluffy caramel colored head with decent lacing.
Taste...This is what I always thought Pumking should taste like. Rich, sweet, bready/crust, and the coffee finish that I crave from a pumpkin ale. Very similar spices to Pumking.
Palate...Pretty smooth but, Id prefer a little less carbonation to balance it out.
Overall...I think they nailed it on this one....almost perfect. Now to find a case. ",95.847,NeZZeN,New York,8.6%,Southern Tier Blackwater Series: Warlock
