Probably one of the lightest mainstream lagers available in Ireland, fairly small frothy head. Tastes as light as it looks, a bit of bitterness but not very much of anything else, slightly malty. Available on tap, in bottles and in cans in Northern Ireland - and occasionally as Harp Ice Cold, which Id probably recommend if you insist on drinking Harp.
Drinkable but excessively bland, on the lower side of average. ",21.576,drumbroneth,Ireland,4.3%,Harp Lager

Hoppy aroma and good solid flavour although by no means unpleasant - flavour certainly fruity, Id say its most like bananas, so slightly sweet although not sickeningly so. Not much bitterness either. Rather potent but very quaffable.  ",92.803,drumbroneth,Belgium,8.4%,Pauwel Kwak
