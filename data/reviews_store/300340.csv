Poured a clear, deep chestnut with a good head. Aroma was enticing with a hint of licquorice. Decent carbonation and lacing accompanied a rounded body and a most unusual licquorice flavour, which was present but not dominant. This beer is unlikely to be to everyones taste, but it is a beer to stimulate conversation and certainly one that I will try to seek out again. Worth a try if only for something different.

Pours an attractive dark colour with a firm and lingering white head. Some lacing. Aroma reminiscent of Belgian ales, but taste is a revelation! First decent encounter with Nelson Sauvin hops and its a good one. A strange meld of reserve ale with a hopheads delight: fruity, hoppy, lingering and balanced mouthfeel. Only (minor) gripe is lively carbonation, but that is easily remedied. A very enjoyable experience. ",67.268,StoutAlchemist,England,7.2%,Art Brew Anarchist Party Bitter
