I really like this cider! It extends well beyond the apple and reaches transcendence in a form rarely realized in ciders that are not ice ciders. The pour is warm golden bronze, still as promised, and welcoming. I love its complex dryness, its crispness and brightness, all of which makes it supremely drinkable, moreish. It is never sweet but never tart either--the balancing act is lovely. Subtle mustiness yet never chalky, the yuzu/kumquat family of small, friendly citrus, carambola and other innocuous fruit throughout and imparting a holistic quality that transcends fruit in the way a superior white wine would do. There are many things to enjoy and it would be a welcome table cider if it were widely available.  ",,Beershine,Canada,12.8%,La Face Cache de la Pomme Inspiration 2013

Delicate lacy head and tendril lace. Dry aroma invokes bay leaf. Gentle carbonation, neither soft nor hard with some pleasing granularity.

Thick opaque black, with thin tan cap. Aroma is rather sharp, not in an alcoholic way, in a molasses and macaroon dough way. Oak chips are evident in the aroma, but the molasses overpowers everything. Intense, big, and sweet. No star anise at all, it is completely lost. The palate is thick and overwhelmed by molasses, so if you like molasses you are in luck. Would go great with dessert. If you do not like molasses you will hate it. Slightly burnt finish. Not a sophisticated beer, but it is enjoyable enough. Hell, if you dont like it, you can easily baste ribs with this stuff!

There is no heat and the palate is exceptionally smooth and soft. This is elevated stuff.

A mellow malty middle adds body and sweetness for balance. I half expected a fail but the smokey tart profile works for groziskie so why shouldnt it work? Whats most remarkable is that the different beers in the blend seem to stand apart, occupying seperate quarters (or thirds as the case may be) and somehow that is what makes it charming.
