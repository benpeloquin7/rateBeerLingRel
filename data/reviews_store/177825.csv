This is a beast- but not in the Micky Rourke Sin City sorta way but more like Mick Jagger with an attitude- and I like it!! Pours dark brown with a beige head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of freshly germinated malt, plum pudding, chocolate and spice. Nice palate with flavours of malt, chocolate and cinnamon spice. Sweet to finish but thats the desired end- and its ok. Would be a great little beer to have at the end of a meal- or sitting in front of the fire hurling abuse at your butler. Either way its enjoyable stuff...

Pours golden orange with a nice persistent off white head. Aromas of passionfruit, gooseberry with malty whiffs in the background. Stylish plate with dried fruit characters and malty notes. Nice bead. Finishes a touch short but Im nit picking here. This is a pretty darn nice beer with that typical Mikkeller assertiveness and cut that we have all come to love. Like slipping into an Armani suit when others are wearing the cheap Chinese imports.  Another please Alfred... ",92.195,Mbroom,Denmark,5%,Mikkeller Tiger Baby

Gassy with off white head that dissipates quickly. Beautiful rose water colour in glass. Lovely aroma of cherry and cranberry with stalky/earthy notes in the background. Palate is light and fresh with red berry/stalky flavours and a light malty finish. Still has plenty of that Haand Bryggeriet house style. Nice beer that is beautifully refreshing on a spring day. ,75.738,Mbroom,Norway,7%,HaandBryggeriet Kreklingl (-2012)
