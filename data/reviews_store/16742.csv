A bit cloying on the finish, but i LOVE the flavor/aroma hops, they really set this beer off. A big-tasting beer at only 5.9, i just put down a Schneider Aventenis(8%) that tasted like water compared to this little guy. And the head is phenomonal... and thats important to all us guys out there :)  thanks SN.  ",93.395,SigPi906,California,5.8%,Sierra Nevada Stout

It poured  in with a dense and almsot instant head that remained for quite some time and looked remarkably well. My first taste was stale thin, overbrewed coffee. My secondary taste was grounds from the bottom of my mug. No hop... ever, and thats ok sometimes, but i prefer my bitterness not come from a cup-a-joe. My opinion says they should probably take Award Winning"" off the label.... only a drunk Irishman would give this beer a medal (no offense to any of you drunk irishmen out there :) ",51.03,SigPi906,Minnesota,,OHaras Sids Irish Stout
