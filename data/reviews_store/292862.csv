The blueberry is noticeable and cheese (similar to wine). It tastes even. The sour isn&apos;t overpowering because it is the perfect combo of the sweet and sour taste in a blueberry. Then the wood flavor comes out at the end of the drink. It paired well with havarti cheese but I not with the cracker

Taste: I get the sweet first (chocolate) and it ends with some bitter coffee flavor like espresso beans roasted with chocolate. The roast is not abundant.
