If there&apos;s any maple here, it&apos;s in the aroma, and its almost indistinguishable. Luckily, it&apos;s also a solid brew. The taste is white pepper, oak bark, a touch of cinnamon, clove, and an aggressive piney dryness. This is much hoppier than its countenance lets on. The bittering hops are assertive and absolutely do not quit. There&apos;s a ghost of a sweetness on the very end hiding under the hop storm that could be the maple, but could well be just caramel malts. The finish is just drier than Bakersfield. I&apos;d drink it again.

It&apos;s far less contrived and ham handed than many other examples out there. It still has the grassy bite and subtle fruity hints of a west coast IPA, but the malt backbone is rich and bold. The dark flavors are ashy and woody. The mouthfeel is medium. Very little head and a light but respectable degree of lacing. All the while I got the feeling that this was truly to style rather than a DIPA/porter mash up. Confident, phenomenal, sexual beer.

Almost hints at being Belgian, but its not. Imagine a Belgian strong ale, with some some of the yeast cut back. The alcohol comes through, but not really representative of how high the ABV is. This is a really complex beer. Feels nice on the palate, too. Its got a little skin to it, if you know what I mean. Only complaint is its like thirteen bucks for (I think) 18oz.

Overall palate is alright. Kind of thin and transient, but the dry hoppy bite stays behind. This beer is very dry. The taste is absolutely oppressive grass and floral. The citrus is lemon. Theres almost a raw celery taste there or something. Its a really harsh, green, leafy flavor. I cant believe the ABV is this low. Nice color, fantastic aroma, but I really didnt like the flavor of this beer very much--not particularly refreshing.

Orange and lemon peel punch to the nostrils. Quite pungent citrus aroma, with a touch of yeast, obviously. First sip was a little surprising; this brew is a thinner body than I was expecting. Not weak and tenuous or anything, but I was expecting a thicker feel. After the citrus and yeast, the brew is grassy and floral. Make no mistake, this beer is Californian before Belgian. The only thing I wasnt impressed with was the appearance. Decent head that recesses into a bit of lace, but the color is a real unassuming, light amber color. But you know, who cares, its a beer, not a mural. Delicious brew, and worth the price of the bomber. Nothing breathtaking, but tasty.
