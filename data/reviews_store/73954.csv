It was sampled from a paper bag so the po-po dont think Im ridin dirty. A dark yellow to almost golden apperance with a moderate whispy white head. It left a nice lace on the pavement as I poured some out for Lo-Dogg. The beer had some corn notes, some fuselage, and also a mild bubblegum character. The finish was a little harsh and slightly sweet. This was rather smooth for a malt liquor. Watch out though G, this shit will wreck yo dome in a hurry. That dogg on the can means bidness.
