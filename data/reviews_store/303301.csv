Not too heavy in any way, nice earthy/ mineral flavors. This was a smooth drinking and clean finishing beer. The end of the glass did not get too bitter. For a stronger beer, none of the alcohol comes through. Bottled version held up as well, easily just as good. ",98.94,mwisemam,Finland,7.2%,Sinebrychoff Koff Porter
