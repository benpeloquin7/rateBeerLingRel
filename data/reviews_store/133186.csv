In one sense, the lemon accent added a sweet citral profile that was totally different than any note provided by a hop varital. On the other side, the sweet lemon seemed to somehow dampen the overall bitterness typical in such a hoppy beer. But in a good way so the beverage was clean and thirst-quenching.
In the end, this was a beautiful and unique IPA that was unlike any I had ever tasted. It will be missed. ",,CaptK,Florida,7.5%,Cigar City Joes Hoppy Time IPA
