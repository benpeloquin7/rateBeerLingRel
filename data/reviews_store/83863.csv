Pours a thick, rich, black, and completely opaque.  1/2 fingers of brown head, which settles quickly into a thin ring of foam, and an incomplete, oily island.

Smells of molasses, roasted malts, coffee, anise infused sweetness, hints of dark fruits and alcohol. Quite excellent.

With taste, ""robust"" is the first thing that comes to mind. Lots of what the nose made me expect; molasses sweetness, and roasty malts and coffee. Hints of alcohol bitterness builds as consumed.

Moderately low carbonation. Thick and full....smooth....the way I want a RIS to feel.

Overall, this is a fab slow sipper, and quite smooth and easy drinking considering its 10 % ABV ....Quite worthy of its high ratings. I (sadly) cant get this stuff around here, but it might be worth it to find a way to snag some more of this canned gem. ",99.894,DoctorDog,Colorado,10.5%,Oskar Blues Ten FIDY

""BOTTLED IN: 2009 C3"" stamped on the back of the neck.

Pours a hazy straw yellow/ light golden. ~1 finger of effervescent white head, which unsurprisingly fades nearly instantly to nothing. No lacing noted.

Smell has a slightly unusual tart, corny/grassy/wheat characteristic. Im straining to detect hints of peaches, but fail. Not bad, just a bit unusual.

The taste is tart. Very tart. I feel like the primary flavors here are citric and ascorbic acid. These must be some extraordinarily young, extremely concentrated peaches....

Feels crisp and light.

Overall, not so great. Just too tart and acidic to drink more than one. I dont think Berliner Weisse is a style that I enjoy tremendously as a stand alone drink, but with its assertive acidic flavoring, I could see it being much more enjoyable paired with some select dishes.

Hazy orange/amber. Pours with 1 1/2 fingers of creamy off white head, which fades slowly to a thin cap. Sporadic lacing as consumed.

Smells of pine and grapefruit hoppiness, followed by very sturdy sweet, malty notes.

Taste shows a decent bit of sweetness on the front, quickly followed by a rush of resinous pine bitterness. After a few pulls, the prevailing theme here is ""resinous/herbal bitterness."" Far less balanced than I was expecting based on the smell.

Moderate carbonation. Fair amount of oily coating.

OK, but just not good enough for repeat business in a market saturated with top notch DIPAs.

Appearance is slightly hazy amber/copper. Pours with 2+ fingers of creamy off white head, which fades slowly to a thin cap; excellent retention. Tons of sticky lacing.

Smells of pine/grapefruit hoppiness. Slight malty notes hide behind the onslaught of hops.

Tastes of grapefruit and pine resin hops, combining for a superbly bitter finish. Fairly solid, sweet caramel malt provides good balance. Alcohol is well blended.

Moderate carbonation with a medium feel. Slightly slick and coating oiliness.

Rock solid. Looks, smells, and taste are all excellent....goes down easy. This is good stuff, and I certainly wish I had another in front of me.

Outstanding. All elements of this brew are above-average to out-of-sight. This is a really good beer, reasonably priced, and a pleasure to drink. It is a damn shame that it is unavailable here in Ohio. ",98.298,DoctorDog,Oregon,6.4%,Deschutes Obsidian Stout

The flavors reveal quite a bit of burnt/smoky roastiness. Light sweetness. A bit of coffee, some slight earthiness. Low ABV stays unsurprisingly inconspicuous.

Moderately high carbonation. Quite thin and watery. This beers major weakness that is holding it back, IMO.

Decent beer with a classic name and label that I was happy to get to try. If the thickness was improved, this beer would be significantly better. ",38.706,DoctorDog,Utah,4%,Wasatch Polygamy Porter
