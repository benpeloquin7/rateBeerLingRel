 I guess this is it, even though the label only mentions the bourbon aging, no specific kind. Red wax sealing.
 Poured down the middle, shows a nice inch-thick, quickly fading foam - brown and bubbly. Black with red edges. Aroma escapes the glass way before I even approach it; I almost get a barleywine sort of sweetness and dried fruitiness, coated in chocolaty bourbon. Putting my nose into the tulip the bourbon overshadows most, but I get a very dense, compact and full aroma that tells me something merged nicely in this one. First sip is velvety and smooth, very sweet and chocolaty, the bourbon almost too dominant, but I kind of like that. Lots of alcohol, but again in a nice imperial stout kind of way: the heat lingers on the palate - as it should in an 11% stout. I like it.
