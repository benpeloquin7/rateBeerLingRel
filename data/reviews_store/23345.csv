I have to say, I bought it for the novelty ($17.99 for four 12 oz. bottles in Athens, GA), but will probably buy four more to store for a while in hopes it will mellow and become creamier.

Poured into Trappist glass. Thick white-chocolate head sits atop cloudy ruby/mahogany body. Fair carbonation. Cloudier toward middle, thick enough to block light. Dramatic malty notes; bruised fruits; figs. Some alcohol to the nose, but not enough to let you know its a 10 percenter. Rich and bready. Notes of nutmeg? Dessert sweet.... desert suite?  Then the bitter cherry finish to balance (though not quite). Cobwebs of lacing slowly drizzle down the glass.
