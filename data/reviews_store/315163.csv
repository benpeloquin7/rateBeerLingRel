On the darkish side and at 4.6% quite a strong beer but is very tasty and not too overpowering as I find some on the stronger side have. Its got slightly bitter sweet aroma but it goes down very well. I would surely have it again but not for a session.  ,87.133,Smilermarmite,Wales,4.6%,Tiny Rebel Cwtch
