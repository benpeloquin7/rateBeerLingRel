I guess that should have been my warning. This beer is not an IPA, or at least it doesnt taste like one. A sweet malty taste, kind of watered down and metallic. It looks kind of watery when poured into a glass as well. Aroma is almost nonexistent. I did drink this after a Stone IPA and Lagunitas Hop Stoopid Ale. It may have fallen so flat because of better beer drank before it. Overall I would say skip this beer.   ",30.122,danrodrigue,California,,Coastal Fog IPA
