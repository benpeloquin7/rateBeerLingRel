To the Kings Head did I stroll, not for the first time. Twas in that castle, in my youth, Id spend every dime. Scarves of every football team hung on every wall. Drinking songs, like cigar smoke, lingered in that hall. And at the bar the punters sat and pissed the time away. I swore Id sit and drink with them until my dying day. My choice in beers and lasses both was vapid, thin and blonde, but deep down a part of me for something deeper longed. One day I called for something else, the barman I surprised. And on that day a deep, black stout for my first time I tried. The barman poured the rich, thick brew with patients and with care, and then he stopped two-thirds the way while at the glass I stared. Cascading like a fountain, those bubbles did their dance, such beauty I had not beheld, I cursed my ignorance. And once the beer had settled, again the barman poured, a frothy head and quaint shamrock atop this dark reward. ""Guinness up!"" the barman called and placed it on the oak. And to my shock the glass, I swear, like God Almighty spoke. ""Who are you to order me?"" to my surprise it asked. ""Some hipster writer, just a boy, Ill kick your little ass."" ""Please,"" said I, ""I didnt know youd give me such a fright. I know that all this time so far, I have been drinking shite."" ""Very well,"" the black pint said, ""sip me long and slow. Ill show you how a beer should taste and down your gullet flow."" And so I raised the glass and sipped, my mind was all atwitter, and roasted barley I did taste so sweet and yet so bitter. The palate was like Irish cream, the likes of which I knew, but never did I think Id get the same feeling from a brew. And so I drank all afternoon, a stout virgin no more. I drank until I could not stand, nor walk across the floor. Years later Im a connoisseur, Ive tried the best and worst. But I have learned its not the beer, its where you had your first.

Then theres that disconnect between what you see and what you smell. Im reminded of the first time I had lobster, that hideous, delicious bottom-feeding demon of the sea. So seldom are my senses so vehemently at war with one another. Then came the taste, which was delightful at first, with plenty of apple and citrus, but then became sickly sweet.
