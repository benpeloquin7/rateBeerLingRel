Miller High Life is a beer staple that will be on shelves long after everyone whos reading this review is dead and gone. A blue collared no nonsense beer for the working man on a buget. Thats pretty much been the base audience of Miller High Life. 

I keep this beer in my fridge when my wallet gets a little slim or I just dont feel like throwing down 15 to 20 dollars for a 6 pack of craft brews. When these bottles are ice cold, they are pretty darn refreshing and pair up weel with pretty much anything for dinner. 

If you like Hootie And The Blowfish, and enjoy wearing turttle neck sweaters, this beer probably wont be for you.  ",0.588,beer_drinker79,Wisconsin,4.6%,Miller High Life

I was a little surprised to see this beer with such a high rating on other sites. 

Negra Modelo is an earthy, malty ale with medium carbonation that goes down pretty smooth and would pair up nicely with just about any meal at the dinner table. This type of beer however, has been done over and over again. It still beats drinking most Bud or Coors brews, but Modelo is going to have to come at me with a little more then just a cute styled bottle and some fancy foil around the neck. I probably wont purchase another six pack of this after mine is gone, but then again, who knows. ",17.67,beer_drinker79,Mexico,5.3%,Negra Modelo
