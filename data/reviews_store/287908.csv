Love the label. Amber, white bubbly head - disappears very quickly. Weak aroma, yeast and some fruits, sweet and a bit spicy. In taste its similar, fruits, sweetness, bit spicy, noticeable alcohol. A bit creamy with spicy bitter aftertaste. Nice but should be more intense - I wish its like the label - naughty and modern in this old, classic style. ",15.097,K42,Poland,8%,Chmielarium Qrdupel

Quite pretty, golden with nice, white head. Aroma is mostly citrus with some fuzzy smell. The same fuzzy-coconut-vegetables flavors in taste but covered by citrus, yeast and nice hoppy bitterness which is long lasting but not to strong. Basically nice (if you ignore the vegetables) and drinkable but to flat. ",78.93,K42,Poland,6.5%,Birbant White AIPA
