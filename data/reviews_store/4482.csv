It is my favorite beer and I think you should give it a shot.  Its a wheat beer (Golden to be exact), so dont expect a very robust taste.  It has an added rasberry flavor to it, which I found a bit unnerving before I tried it but very appealing after my first sip.  One problem, however, is the inconsistancy with the brew.  Sometimes it has a lighter rasberry flavor, and sometimes it has a much more present rasberry flavor.  If you dont like it the first time you try it, try it again a month or so later and you might have a brew from a different batch.  The batches from the kegs tend to have a much more present rasberry taste and a smoother feel to it.
