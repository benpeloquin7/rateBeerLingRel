I had had the strong Swamp ape Double Ipa a while back, and it was decent. This how ever is quite different. The smoke is a peat smoke, which is rare in beers but is common in Islay scotches. If you are a scotch drinker and love the medicinal flavors of a peated scotch, then you will love this. Surprisingly it seems less hoppy than its non smoked counterpart, which is good so that you can appreciate the peat smoke. You might forget its an IPA at first, as you are getting used to the smoke, but after a few sips, the crisp clean hops you expect from a good ipa are noticeable but not overly bitter. I also had the non smoked version recently and would suggest anyone who was underwhelmed to also give that another try as the current score of 69 is no longer appropriate and easily should score in the 90s. The hops were crisper and cleaner than i had remembered them being when i tried a year or so ago. ",,kogdog,Florida,10%,Florida Beer Swamp Ape DIPA - Smoked
