The taste is less bitter than some IPAs with the hint of sweetness from the maple syrup at the finish adding a nice change from the norm.  Even though its 7.5% ABV, this beer is very easy to drink and one 750ml bottle is the perfect amount.  Dogfish Head has really crafted one of the better IPAs that Ive had and has taken the best of what they offered and has made it just that much better by adding that sweet-ish finish.  I will certainly have to pick up another to cellar and see if, perhaps, the smoothing out of the hops over time further accentuates the sweetness of the maple.

Although I may not be the target audience for this gluten-free beer, I decided to give it a shot and Im glad that I did.  

The pour is a crystal clear orange/copper color and the beer had a pretty solid head.  Having never had a sorghum beer before, the smell was certainly unique although not unpleasant and the citrus notes werent overpowered by any means.  I got some of that same flavor in the first taste as well as a hoppy bitterness that was appropriate for the style.  

It certainly has a sweet characteristic early that tapers away to the citrus/bitter aftertaste.  After one or two sips, the unique flavor of the sorghum became far more pleasant to my palate and by the third or fourth sip, this became a very refreshing and easy to drink brew.

Although I have no other gluten-free beers to compare this to, I do think that it stood its own compared to even non-gluten-free APAs.  The 6.8% ABV never gets in the way of this surprisingly well balanced beer that I got through pretty darn quickly.

I will certainly try this again in the future and I hope that this local venture is a success in the emerging gluten-free market. ",12.739,indyjb,New York,6.8%,Steadfast Sorghum Pale Ale
