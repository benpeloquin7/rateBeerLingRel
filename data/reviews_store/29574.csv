Like drinking home-made cookie dough.  One of my favourite beers.  Clear, light amber colour hides the full body, and sweet thickness of this beer.  Friuty and flowery with a thick head, and great lacing.  Best on tap when you can find a pub that pours authentic Belgian style.  Drink it right at 70 degrees.

Definately not a beer to drink ice cold as it loses its flavor.  Deep amber hue with a surprisingly smooth, short finish.  Slightly sweet, with an almost honey overtone.  I look forward to next years formula. ",15.644,BeerMan2000,Colorado,5.6%,Coors Winterfest
