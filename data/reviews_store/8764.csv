It is one of thee greatest beers out there. It has made me and my friends memories that we can and some what vaguely remember. Without it college and highschool would not have been the same. I can actually say that i can casually drink this beer on a warm summer day. So if one does not think it is a good beer maybe they do not know what good beers are for. ,,JohnNWill,Missouri,4.2%,Natural Light
