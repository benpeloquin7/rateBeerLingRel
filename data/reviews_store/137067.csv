If you are only having a bit of it.  Let me explain. This cider looks, tastes and feels like freshly pressed cider. However, it is so sweet that the sweetness becomes overpowering towards the end of a 10 oz pour, nevermind the whole bottle. Two of us shared this as dessert after some great bbq and neither one one of us finished his glass. Overall, I like it despite that it is not very drinkable.

Some are put off by the light straw hue....  But those that know cider will recognize this as a sign of quality fruit used in a quality process.
No oxidation = light hue.
Excellent! ",,ninjaskier,California,6.99%,Julian Hard Cider Harvest Apple
