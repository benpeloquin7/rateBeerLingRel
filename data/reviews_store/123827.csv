The crisp entry, and smooth finish was enamoring, but the subtle but festive apple and very slight cinnamon notes were so evocative of christmas cider, and the dark English toffee notes so very holiday-ish, I couldnt help but love this beer.  Tremens in still my faovrite, but this was definitely a triumph. ",95.079,Northbay_Stout,Belgium,10%,Delirium Nol

Smooth, slightly sharp, crisp, and finishing clean.  Nice balance, good nose, if somewhat muted in intensity.  What blew me away was the draft iteration I just had this week, pulled from a nice new keg.  The malt is much more prominent, with a great smooth texture I didnt get in the bottle.   Most of my high marks for this beer, in fact, stem from the draft version, as I have rarely noticed such a marked improvement between the two service mediums.  Delicious and easy in the bottle, an amber, sunset colored masterwork in a pint glass. ",82.996,Northbay_Stout,California,6.75%,Lagunitas Censored (Kronik)

Most beers with any strong additive flavor tend to focus so much on whatever they jacked their brew with that the subtlety of the beer is lost in a sea of raspberries, coffee, etc...  So, heres to Lagunitas for making a coffee beer thats actually balanced, with the proper subordinate flavor. ",95.258,Northbay_Stout,California,9.26%,Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout
