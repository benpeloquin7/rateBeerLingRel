Except for the aroma, which is hearty, hoppy, and beautiful. The finish in the taste is so clean in comparison to the booziness in the taste, so for that reason alone I think this is an exceptional version of the American Tripp. Gotta love the FF Exit Series and this first of many great beers to come.

Might as well start off in style. Amazing beer. Aroma is a combo of sour fruit and charred rubble with a tinge of pepper spiciness. Mouthfeel is thick...super thick. Gets softer as it warms. Melds with the mouth as it approaches room temp. Flavor (to me) is Zhukov with big dark, partially sour fruit, teenie tiny tinges of vanilla and cinnamon, smokey charred goodness, all drenched in a blanket of bittersweet chocolate.  This may be my first rating, but it is far from my first beer...and Ive never had anything like this. World class, but very left of center. If you live for beer, make sure you try this one before you expire. ",,vingio311,Florida,11%,Cigar City Hunahpus Imperial Stout
