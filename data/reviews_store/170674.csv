Minimal aroma despite a lot of head on the pour. Fairly hazy pour but goes down very smoothly and doesnt taste like 9.5% ABV. Taste of clove and fruits, slight apple flavor it seemed.
Very good beer overall ",96.985,cubsfan05,New York,9.5%,Ommegang Gnomegang

Minimal aroma I thought. Pours a very dark brown, almost a molasses color. Superb taste, sweet flavor and strong hints of bourbon and vanilla. Fantastic flavor that drinks very smoothly despite being quite boozy at 13.4%.

I expected a lot more from this beer, I have to say.  No aroma to speak of.  Golden hue which is surprisingly clear and minimal head, if any, which disappears almost instantly.
