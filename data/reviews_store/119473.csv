Pours a dark dark red/brown with a finger of light khaki foam. Nose starts off very lambic like with lemons and funk with some dark fruit. Some chocolate and caramel but its very brett forward.  In some sniffs I get some burnt plastic. Taste is a nice balance of funky musk, grape juice then roast and chocolate malt. It comes off as a light beer despite being 7/8ths stout. Really complex and unique. Definitely mouth puckering. This is a weird beer, the lambic and stout really stand out and they somehow work here. Its still a goofy ass style, its been in my fridge for about three months before I said to myself that a soured stout sounds like a good idea. Its also expensive and I wish it saw the 375ml format instead. I dont know Tilquin...good job? ",94.532,davey101,Belgium,7%,Tilquin / Rulles Stout Rullquin
