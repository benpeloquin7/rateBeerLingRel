Great caramel and dark fruit in the aroma, little hops to muddle it, well-balanced sweetness.  Pours sweet-tea brown with a slight off-white head which held for less than a minute.  No lacing, but hey! I dont think this is that kind of beer.  For me, this bottle delivered a beautiful shadow of an afternoon in Munich. ",40.629,StarlingBrew,Germany,5.2%,Spaten Mnchen Dunkel
