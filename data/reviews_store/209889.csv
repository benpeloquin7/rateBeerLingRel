They loved it, so do I. Its a seasonal brew, hard to find. If you are able to get your hands on this beer, you have to try it! Almost black in color with a nice mahogany head. Being a wheat beer didnt exspect so much complex flavors. The dark roasted malt and caramel flavors gives way to a slight wooden note and makes this dark beer almost drink like a lighter beer. Its too bad its not a all year round brew.
