Aroma is nice oak and slight whiskey. Appearance is a reddish hue with a nice tan head. Taste is down right PERFECT. Has some initial whiskey flavor without the harsh whiskey edge, mellowed nicely with caramel, maple smoothness. A very nice mouth feel that is creamy and smooth.
This one is easily one of my top 3 beers ever. ",97.152,Wallrus00,Colorado,10.27%,Great Divide Old Ruffian - Oak Aged
