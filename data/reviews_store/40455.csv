Poured an unnatural looking clear reddish amber.  Head is off-white.  Aroma is citrusy and without much character.  The flavor is thin with a bitter bite although again, the bitterness feels more contrived than as a result of any true hoppiness.

If its free, it wont kill you to drink but I cant imagine forcing more than two down in a sitting.  Other than that, I wouldnt pay for it.  It is overall a below average brew.    ",13.577,mickaelangelo,Missouri,5.3%,Green Valley Brewing Stone Mill Pale Ale
