WOW! Very nice beer indeed. Im a big fan of the style. Ans Stone pulls it off like a champ.

OK.. so 

A. Pours out black with a nice light tan head. Nice lacing. Not much light comes through the black. Maybe a bit, with a tad dark brown and ruby highlights... but faint. 

S. Roasted malt, Hops, and a hint of cherry. Very compelling. 

T. Fist comes the roasted malt, followed immediately by fresh hops, then finishing with a black cherry followed by bitterness that sticks for a bit. Very nice. 

M. Medium body, Creamy, Slightly sticky, with a well balanced carbonation. 

D. Quite impressive. Very complex for the style. Almost a contradiction in a way... but in a really good way. Overall ver impressive. Not much to complain about really. Possibly.. well no... on second thought.. nothing really to complain about on my end. I love it. 

Will buy again. Often ",99.577,BatBeer,California,8.7%,Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Black IPA

Bottle, Nice looking w/ a bit stiff of an opening hinge(could have just been mine). Pours a clear filtered golden colour. Aroma a bit weak, but not bad. Smells of hops and floral. Flavour, hops, slightly sweet, floral, and a bit of yeast. Tastes ok, a bit watery, but not as horrible as some reviews indicate. Mouthfeel is thin, but still present. Carbonation is a little high, but not horrible. It does however seem a bit off balance w/ alcohol finish. Seems to be a strong presence of alcohol for such a low percentage. Overall not great, but not too bad either. Just kind of, alright. I would however say, it deserves better than a 9. Hell, Even Budweiser American Ale, which is awful, gets a 22. So this beer deserves a little higher of a rating. Im not saying its great, but better than shown rating.  ",9.048,BatBeer,France,6%,Fischer Biere Blonde

Pours a somewhat deep copper/amber. Good amount of head, that lasts for a bit before backing off. Aroma is of a sweet apricot smell, with hops standing behind it. Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied, little bit of stickiness(which is good). Flavour is pretty great, strong IPA characteristics, followed by the apricot backing. Slightly sweet. Finishes with hops and alcohol presence. Not overpowering though. Definitely balanced, and definitely a dogfish head offering. Very well made. I would recommend to anyone who likes IPAs as well as fruity notes.
