Smell - None really to speak of. Smells faintly of some hops, but that is all.

Taste - Largely tasteless with a bitter bite at the end indicative of some hop content in the beer. Some faint rice or grain notes. Preferable taste over Budweiser or Bud Light, but trumps not many other beers. Leaves the mouth and enters the throat dry (hops).

Mouthfeel - Watery. No body to speak of. Some carbonation note while in the mouth.

Overall - Not a very good beer. If you are drinking to get intoxicated cheaply and do not want to totally hate the experience, probably a good beer. Would prefer Yuengling for the latter task, but I might be biased being from Tampa and all (Yuengling distillery in Tampa).

About a finger of head with an aggresive pour. Some stickage to the sides of the glass as it is swirled around.

Smell - Sweet, malty aromas with a hint of raisin and plum. Not the most overpowering smell in the world and not as strong as some other Quadrupels.

Taste - Overall, the taste was pretty underwhelming. The initial taste was a slight bitterness which transitioned into sweet near the end of the sip. With some retro-nasal breathing you could taste the raisins and plums and some maltiness. Maybe a slight caramel flavor too. Fairly complex taste.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied. Not much carbonation and very smooth. Could not feel the affects of the abv. until after I had drunk nearly the whole 750 mL bottle.

Overall - It was good, but not great. I have had better Quadrupels (from Rochefort) and better overall beers (Hopslam).

Smell - Not much to speak of. Faint malt smell with no fruit essence to speak of.

Taste - Overall probably the best of the lower tier non-craft beers. Faint malt taste at the beginning giving way to a slightly bitter taste as it goes down. Didnt bother to do any retro-nasal breathing with this one. No dried fruits or floral notes to speak of.

Mouthfeel - More heavily bodied than the other widely available beers. Heavy carbonation present while it is in the mouth. Goes down fairly smooth.

Overall - Like mentioned earlier, it is probably the best of the widely available beers and my choice if I am just hanging out with friends or at a local (normal) bar. The fact that you can actually taste some malt when you drink it shows they have at least spent some time and care brewing this beer.

Smell - Malty and slightly sweet smell. Some dried fruit and earthy notes. 

Taste - Not as impressed as with some quadrupels I have had. Maybe it is because I have tried several quadrupels now (and am not used to Dubbels), but I feel as if this beer is just attempting to copy the other (better) quadrupels out there. I taste heavy malt taste that is not very sweet as all (despite the fact that my mouth and glass lip are sticky by the end of the tasting). Also in there are some dried fruits and earthy notes. Maybe some star of anise as well.

Mouthfeel - Not too heavily bodied as to be overpowering. Despite there being a lot of carbonation on the pour you cannot taste too much of it in your mouth (a good thing for me). 

Overall - What can I say? Maybe I have become a quadrupel snob with the likes of Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort, but I like a sense of sweetness and fruit in my beer. This just feels like a semi-good imitation beer. Really cannot tell the big difference between a Quadrupel and Dubbel.

About one half finger of head after an aggressive pour by the bartender. Head disappears about after 5 minutes. 

Smell - Very sweet and tart smelling. You can really smell the raspberries coming through in this brew. 

Taste - Very tart and sour at the first sip leading into a pleasant sweetness near the end. Taste can get a little sickening sweet after nearing the end of a glass. Some carbonation taste in the mouth with also strong taste of raspberries. 

Mouthfeel - As stated earlier, there is some carbonation characteristic to this lambic. Very sticky feeling in the mouth from all of the sugar. Goes down rather dry.

Overall - Used to be my favorite lambic, before I had tried any others. After refining my palate a little bit, I realize that this is an above average lambic, but is not the best one out there.

Smell - Heavy brandy and alcohol smell. What really could you expect from a beer that is 18% abv? I sense dried fruits and maybe a hint of licorice as well.

Taste - After trying this as my first stout, I realize that was probably not the best choice. I really did not like it. The brandy taste was overpowering to the point that I did not taste that sweetness that I oh so expected from this stout. In addition, instead of chocolate as some reviews suggest, I tasted a heavy note of coffee near the end of the sip. Licorice and some dried fruits were noted as well with some pretty intense retro-nasal breathing. 

Mouthfeel - Like holding a watered down syrup in your mouth. No carbonation to speak of and no hoppy aftertaste to erase the previous sips effects.

Smell - Smell could have left something to be desired. I would have liked more cherry scents and less musty earthiness. Overall, an above average smell.

Taste - Pretty darn good. You are greeted with an initial musty, earthy taste that isnt all that pleasant, but this transforms into a faint cherry sweetness near the end of the sip.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied. Can really taste some hidden carbonation here as you swirl it around your mouth.

Overall - A pretty good lambic beer. While framboise is more of my preferred flavor for lambics, kriek is also pretty good as well. I enjoy the fact that this beer was not overally tart and sweet like Lindemans Framboise is, but it tended toward the more not sweet at all side, which I didnt like.

Taste - Well, it was better than most widely distributed American brews. Really tasted the maltiness in the beer. Was not present to the point of being overpowering, which is good. Good for a middle tier beer.

Mouthfeel - Left a little to be desired. More watery and thin than expected and you really taste the carbonation as you swish the beer around in your mouth.

Taste - Not impressed. Just another cookie cutter malt taste that could have had something going with the sweet tinge at the end of the sip if it werent ruined by that burnt nut/coffee taste at the end.

My brothers are the ones that buy this beer all the time and they keep it in the garage. I will walk into the garage and can immediately tell if this beer is present because it smells like marijuana. 

Taste - it reminds me of drinking spoiled beer. The taste is unique if there is anything good to say about it. Really have never tasted any other beer that tastes like this one. Can detect some slight corn taste with some retro-nasal breathing. 

Mouthfeel - Like drinking carbonated water. Not any body to the beer to speak of.

Smell - Heavy citrus notes. Grapefruit was most prevalent with orange and floral notes coming in a distant second. Quite a sweet smelling beer as well.

Taste - Wow. I thought Quadrupels were my favorite beer. The bottle describes the taste as ""bitter and biting""; thank God that wasnt true. This could not have been more smooth and pleasant.

A lot of lacing on the glass as you swirl the beer around the glass. 

Smell - Heavy hops smell mixed with citrus notes. This beer smells very similar to Bells Hopslam, but also has a slightly bitter smell mixed in that the Hopslam did not have. 

Taste - initially you get a pleasant and smooth hoppy taste which then morphs into some heavy citrus notes. Can taste grapefruit and orange. The only downside to the taste is that this beer has a heavy bitter bite at the end. I enjoy a nice strong finish to a beer, but not this strong. 

Mouthfeel - Pleasant medium body at the beginning with a moderate amount of carbonation while the beer is in your mouth. The heavy hops that are in this beer really dry your mouth and throat at the end.

Overall - Reminded me quite a bit of Bells Hopslam, but with an unpleasant bitter taste at the end. Despite that, I was pretty impressed with this beer. I enjoy the fact that they just didnt want to copy the Hopslam taste but try a little bit less hop bitterness at the end.

There is an orange-yellow look to this beer with a white head (about 1/4 of a finger of head with this beer on a fairly aggressive pour). Color is very reminiscent of champagne with carbonation trailing up the sides of the snifter glass. 

S - a very complex smell that you would usually find with other brands quadrupels. You can really smell dark fruits in this one. Some yeast and cellar funk (others will call this barnyard funk, but I have had occasion to smell this particular scent before and it was in a cellar). Faintly sweet smelling as well. 

T - Very good for a belgian pale ale. If I was going for a pale ale, this would be my choice (although this style of beer isnt my overall favorite). Around 40 degrees drinking temperature, the dark fruits dominate the taste. You can also taste the yeast in there as well. A slight tinge of sweetness, but nothing you wouldnt notice without really looking for it. As the beer warms up, the dark fruits come forward even more and the beer becomes even smoother. A real pleasant surprise. 

M - very smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Wow, is this smooth. You can feel the carbonation as you swish it around your mouth and cannot really feel the booziness of this beer until you let it sit your stomach for a while. 

O - While the not the overall best beer that I have ever had, this beer is near the top. Top in its style that I have had. Its just very smooth overall and very drinkable. I was very pleasantly surprised to note some dark fruits in this beer as I would with quadrupels. Just a testament to the genius of the monks of the St. Sixtus Abbey.

A - this lambic was poured into a snifter glass that I drink pretty much every one of my classy beers from. The appearance of this beer was exquisite. It looked exactly like the inside of an apricot (maybe a tinge lighter than the real fruit). Not much head to speak of on this beer (1/8 of a finger of head). Some carbonation beads trailing up the sides of the beer. 

S - you can smell that cellar funk that is common with many Cantillon brews. Really the smell of this lambic was the only thing that didnt impress me. There was a faint apricot smell to the beer and some sweet notes as well. 

T - a very impressive taste to this beer. You can really taste the apricot in the beer. There is some sweetness in the beer, but nothing that is overpowering. Upfront, there is that cellar funk that comes from the wild yeast., but that quickly disappears. What you are left with is a strong apricot essence with an accompanying pleasing sweetness. 

M - there is some carbonation in this beer, but nothing that is overpowering. As you swish it around your mouth, it feels very smooth and not at all watery. You can really tell that they have packed a lot into this beer. 

O - what can I say? My introduction to Cantillon brews was a success. I use to think (in my younger days) that Lindemans was the essence of what a lambic should be. I realized later that beers should pull their greatness from natural ingredients and not added sugar. Cantillon really shows that natural ingredients can come together to make a beer that really puts the fruit it was aged with in the forefront. ",99.736,ajcobb24,Belgium,5%,Cantillon Fou Foune

Not the most impressive appearance to the beer. Poured into a snifter glass with one half finger of head. Color is golden yellow. 

S - yeast notes and faint sweetness dominate the smell of this beer. Other than that there is not much of a smell to speak of.

T - Very good. Not the best beer I have had by far, but still some pleasant notes detectable in this beer. Can definitely taste some yeast funk in here with some sweet notes. Some dried fruits are present as well, but not to a great degree. Near the end of the sip there is some definite hop bitterness that becomes present.

M - very smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Some slight carbonation notes can be detected as well.

O - Overall there is not much to set this beer apart from other beers out there. The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is very drinkable and smooth on the palate. There is some hop bite near the end of the sip that makes a little less enjoyable for me, but overall it is an above average beer.
