Roast coffee, notes of caramel, clean and slightly sweet, no hops. Mouthfeel a little light and fizzy, tastes very slightly acidic and sweet, bitter finish, with lasting roast coffee taste.
Overall fairly tame but enjoyable, though possibly a little over carbed. ",57.462,mrmansfeld,Switzerland,6%,Docteur Gabs Tnbreuse
