Smelled sweet, mostly bourbon and coffee, hints of syrup and vanilla.  Nice balance of the major elements, coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. Delicate, but present maple syrup taste, not overpowering. Sweet, but balanced.  Creamy with a crisp finish.  Overall great beer with great flavor and balance. ",,freehafe,Michigan,10.6%,Founders Backstage Series # 2: CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)
