Appearance: light amber/yellow, mild cloudiness, finger of head, nice lacing.

Taste: Awesome! This Tastes more like an IPA than I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to be a smooth light orangey fruit ale but there is a strong presence of hops that give it a similar flavour to Driftwoods Fat Tug IPA which is my absolute second favourite beer at the moment. This is hoppy, citrusy, complex and flavourful ending with a nice blood orange and yeast aftertaste that fades quickly. 

Overall: This is not at all what I was expecting to find when I bought the bottle(I think a more mild and fruity blood orange beer would be ideal as a summer seasonal) but it is a delicious brew worthy of note. The fact that it reminds me of one of my favourite IPAs definitely helps and probably affected my scoring a little bit.
