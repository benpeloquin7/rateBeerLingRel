The beer has an aroma of a chocolate spice. First sip is kind of an impact of flavors with a chocolate taste but finishes with a spicy kick. This beer definitely is a heavy/rich beer. Not my cup of tea but still a good beer.  ,95.079,valerieglasgow,Colorado,9%,New Belgium Lips of Faith - Cocoa Mole

First pour it has a nice reddish hue to it and the aroma was a sweeter smell. The taste however really threw me for a loop, at first it was really bitter and tasted like a leather but after letting it sit for a few minutes it still had that leather flavor but not as prominent. Overall I thought it was a decent beer, there definitely could have been something more to the flavor.  ",90.703,valerieglasgow,Colorado,9.1%,Odell Shenanigans
