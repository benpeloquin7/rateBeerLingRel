Once settled, some of the carbonation had fallen out, but the overall taste was still delightful. Since a lot of the carbonation seemed to have disappeared in the head, the palate was a bit flat- taste did not suffer though. Nose is sweet with a bit of tang. Has a deeper, rich flavor which only truly comes out once the beer had left the tongue, which perhaps can be attributed to the wild yeast (an enhancing component). Overall very nice example of a belgian ale.  ",98.244,scts18,Michigan,8%,Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza
