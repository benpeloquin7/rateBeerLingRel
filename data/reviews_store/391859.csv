Strong coffee aroma and taste/finish with chocolate/oat undertones. Has bitter coffee finish. Very smooth for high ABV and not nearly as heavy as most other oatmeal stouts. My review was of recently tapped keg so cannot comment on cans/bottles. Great cold weather brew.  ,99.259,jnol2238,Georgia,9.4%,Terrapin Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout
