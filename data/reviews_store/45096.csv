Smells fruity enough but positively explodes with plum pudding and sherry greatness in the mouth. Little head, just a few bubbles, sumptuous colour. Gentle fizz gives it a pleasant tang, then a smouldering warmth takes over -- and stays. I shared a bottle with my significant other. This is my other bottle. I think you know what Im saying.
