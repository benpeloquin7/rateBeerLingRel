Somebody should make these beer snobs take a test before they are permitted to post, then again maybe I wouldnt be able to post here..... This beer has a full robust flavor with no watered down soft drink flavor like the mainstream top 5 producers. Get a grip snobs you lost your way, the reason we drink beer is to take the edge off the daily grind and not break our bank. Now I will return to drinking my 10 dollar a 6 pack Guinness Stout I was in the mood for tonight!!!!  ",21.956,Prehensile,Pennsylvania,4.4%,Yuengling Traditional Lager
