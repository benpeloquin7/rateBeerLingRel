The first time I couldnt rate it because it was so absolutely wonderful that I was distracted. It has the perfect blend of bourbon, vanilla, and malty nose. Its smooth almost to its fault, as I can drink it as though its simply dessert(to be quickly devoured and absolutely enjoyed). I could and would drink a 6 pack of this for a hefty price. My deScription might not be concise or helpful but know this...if this beer hits your lips and you dont enjoy it, something is wrong with you.

The color is lighter than I normally enjoy.  It definitely tastes a little hoppier than previous firestones but I find it balances the slightly syrupy vanilla brown sugar flavors.  I taste a lot of parabola which Ill never complain about considering its in my top 5 favorite beers. Overall I am very excited about drinking many more of these.  ,99.736,MrsRickyisms,California,12.5%,Firestone Walker 15 (XV)

I am not a fan. I find it thin and as my boyfriend would say it is laden with Belgian yeast.. I prefer my own yeast. ",43.971,MrsRickyisms,California,6.8%,Uncommon Brewers Bacon Brown Ale
