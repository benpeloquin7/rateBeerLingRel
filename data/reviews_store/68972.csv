Not to heavy if you are going to have a few.  Brown amber color with a white medium head that lasted awhile.  Roasted malt nose.  A very slight alcohol taste is not a problem.  A slightly bitter finish.  A nice carbonation balance with a finish I enjoy. ,55.282,BlauVogel,Massachusetts,4.9%,Samuel Adams Boston Lager
