Looks like a slightly lighter-colored version of the standard Guinness with a two-inch thick head that doesnt go away. Tastes like a 70/30 mixture of water and Guinness, but a little sweeter and without the coffee notes of the original. It has no body or mouthfeel at all- you might get a bit of foam on the first few sips, but the liquid is essentially water. Carbonation is negligible- on a scale of 1 to 10 its a 2. The finish is quick except for a lingering unpleasantly earthy/bitter taste in the mouth.

This is an exceptionally disappointing beer. Im actually embarrassed for them for putting the Guinness name on it. On the other hand, given how light it is and the relatively low ABV, its great for when you want to order something with a brand name and drink something that looks like beer without any of the inconveniences of a worthwhile product.

0/10 would not buy or drink again. ",29.039,NomDeGuerre,Ireland,4.1%,Guinness Red Harvest Stout
