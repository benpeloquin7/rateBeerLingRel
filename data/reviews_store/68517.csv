The smell was hoppy, not too fruity, maybe some citrus but it didnt really have that fruity Belgian smell. The first taste I had made me think I wasnt going to be able to drink 26 oz. of this stuff. I didnt really like it, it tasted strong and finished with a clove flavor. The flavors really turned me off. It was better as I drank more, but not overly so.

The head was small, white and dissipated rather quickly. The smell was fairly faint, especially for the style, Belgian golden ale, but smelled of fruit, maybe apricots, and floral hops. The initial taste was very good, kind of sweet, but in a good way. The finish was also very good with a good hop bitterness. I didnt get the Avery out of the fridge early enough so the beer was rather cold when I began. That may have muted the aroma and it certainly affected the taste. As the beer warmed to cellar temperature and beyond, hey it was 24 oz, the flavors really opened up. I got a bit of a smell of apple and the hops flavor was more present.

The smell of the beer was intoxicating, a sign of things to come, it smelled of a Mediterranean fruit fair, figs, dates and raisins. The taste was full and multilayered. On the top was the fruit flavors and on the bottom was a bit of a good dessert wine with some chocolate in between.  The high alcohol content affects the taste slightly when drinking at room temperature taking away a little bit of the pleasure of drinking the Sixth Glass.
