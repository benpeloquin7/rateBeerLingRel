On tap is alot better gives time for the awfull smell to escape You can keep it!! To the people who are from the UK Get a grip people. Your lagers are different to ours and to those in the states as you live in a Cold hell hole and we live in a tropical paradise which needs a lighter lager not something that needs to be spoon fed to us..  ,3.673,ScottFNQ,Australia,4.6%,Tooheys New

But now i live in HOT Nth Qld i understand why this beer is so loved in QLD. its a good beer to drink in the tropics. So if your from a colder climate (yes that includes Sydney) then its pretty pointless of you rating it. Good beer for the region where it comes from.  ,1.618,ScottFNQ,Australia,3.5%,Castlemaine XXXX Gold Lager

For those of you who live in colder climates probably wont like it because u are used to a heavier style of beer. If you live in the hot tropics as i do its a nice beer on a 95% humidity afternoon. Good one Boags ,1.912,ScottFNQ,Australia,4.8%,Boags St George
