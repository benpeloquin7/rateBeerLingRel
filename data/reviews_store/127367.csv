Enjoyed in a snifter, courtesy of the owner at One Mile House in NYC. Has a great dark brown, ruby-tinged color to it. Smell has a combo of yeast and bananas, but not strong, more subtle like dried bananas. Described as a quad, my mind had a hard time with the flavor until reading the bottle yielded that ""ah-ha!"" moment - molasses. Finishes with a slight bit of alcohol burn, but very, very tiny compared to its big 12% ABV. Overall one of the best beers Ive had. ",99.365,yankeepride,California,12%,AleSmith Decadence 2012

My first mistake was not reading ratings about it being a cork rocket. With the final twist of the cage, I was grateful it wasnt pointing at my face or Id be blind in one eye. Its annoyingly carbonated, both in the pour and the body. However, once in my snifter, I swirled out most of the bubbles in order to get to the real flavors. 

I found the nose to be delightfully wine/grape oriented, with no hint of it being 11.25% ABV. You could tell it had a lot of quad to its base, but it was a thinned-out version of one with none of the usual complexity. It goes down easy, but once youve swallowed it ... wait for it ... theres that warming bourbon burn left behind. I personally found it to be good, not great, but my wife absolutely loved it as someone who likes those flavors but is put off by more than about 2 ozs of a BCBS-class beer.

On first pour, you get a strong whiff of the brown sugar, then when you get closer, you get that old familiar Lagunitas-blast of hops. Its one of those perfect-pour beers; just throw it down the middle, and it will perfectly sort out two fingers of foam atop a caramel-colored body. Upon first taste, it seems a bit sweet, but the more you have, the more the lingering hops begin to dominate the profile, giving you a terrific malt/hop combination of flavors.
