Slight metallic background scent. Color is a rich, deep brown with a slight mahogany hue when held up to light. Nice tan, foamy top. Legs form well on glass due to ABV. Flavor is very toasty with slightly burned toast taste due to hops that immediately follow the toasty malts. Hop is moderately high and matches aroma well with florals and pine. Lingering bitterness and slight metallic taste. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonic and hop bite. Metallic scent and taste becomes slightly stronger as beer warms up. Good beer overall. Would like it a little more if not for the metallic taste lingering late into flavor. ",97.592,jeannelbaz,Michigan,8.9%,Founders Dark Penance Imperial Black IPA
