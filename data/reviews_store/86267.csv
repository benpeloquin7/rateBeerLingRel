Pours a hazy orange-reddish brown, with a thin head which quickly fades into a film.  The flavor begins with a sweetness, which is quickly shoved away with a malty must, and then finished by a sourness.  The mouth feel is nice.  This beer is not too thick, nor thin.  It has just the right amount of bubbling, which happens to be light.  I am not a fan of over/under-carbonated beers... but for this style, the carbonation is perfect.  After partaking into about 6 ounces of this clever brew... I find myself pleasantly buzzed, cant wait to finish it. ",97.647,johnmal85,Delaware,15%,Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine

At 9% ABV this Imperial IPA hides it well with the hops and malt.  It has a light brown look in a snifter, and has a finely bubbled head.  After  the pour I took a sniff, which was heavily malted with sweetness, and had a tad bit of hop aroma.  The alcohol was very well hidden.  The mouth-feel is slightly viscous, and has just the right amount of carbonation.  The alcohol warms your innards, and the flavor of the alcohol dissipates quickly.  The beer comes off on the tongue sweetly, and progresses into a spicy hop.  It is all finished with a nice grassy bit of sweetness.  Very awesome beer.

Attractive labeling, with a semi-pleasing pour.  Head is nice, almost milky foam yet retains some bubbling.  I am not a fan of beers with large bubbling, seeming slightly over-carbonated.  Aroma is nice and wheaty, with a dominance of alcohol.  The aroma also has a bite of grassy hops in the beginning, with a finish of sweetness.  The look of the beer is somewhat akin to an unfiltered wheat.  The taste comes carbonated on the tongue, progressing into sweetness topped with hops, and finally maturing to an alcohol infused malted, slightly bitter finish.  Overall, a decent brew.  Not a flagship beer, but should be at least in the 70th percentile, not 46. ",46.479,johnmal85,Pennsylvania,6.2%,Weyerbacher Muse
