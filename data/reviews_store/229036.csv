Serves nicely without excessive foaming, thick orange-brown color. Once the bottle pops open citrus, pine and earthly scents. Taste is bittersweet again with citric flavors being dominant and followed by a hint of peach (?) before the bitterness follows, perfectly balanced. Definitely the best Greek beer in the market at the moment. ",96.136,psontis,Greece,8.2%,Septem A.C.E.
