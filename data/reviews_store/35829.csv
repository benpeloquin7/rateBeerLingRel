I can just say... stunning beer... a present of mother nature, heaven in you mouth. Its incredible how you can play with elements of nature to make such a delicious liquid.
One thing that suprises me is that its not that different from the St-Bernardus Abt 12, which has been my favourite beer until now. I cant say which of the two is the best... they are both just perfect brews, both better then the Rochefort 10 in my opinion. Ill have this as much as I can!
