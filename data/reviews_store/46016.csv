I must have drunk 10 samples of this stuff during the two day event.  Poured an opaque black while cascading into a fine frothy head; perfect!  The aroma was incredible if youre a BB lover.  Sweet vanilla, chocolate, oak, and of course, bourbon notes abound; could inhale this all night.  The taste was superb; roasted chocolate malt, vanilla, and oak blend so well with the bourbon that it just melts in the mouth.  Very smooth and creamy with a very slight hint of ABV; which is scary!

Pours a light to medium burgundy with slight white head!  Has a pleasant tart funky barnyard aroma with a touch of blueberry maybe a little cranberry in the background.   Gotta love this soft tart blueberry zest; just enough to cause the lips to smack with delight.  Much less acidic and sour than some other Cantillon fruit Lambics though.  The mouth feel was pleasant with some carbonation along with a perfect balance of Blueberry tartness/acidity.  This is definitely one of the best fruit Lambics on the market today.

Once on tap at the Waregem beerfest (08), and also at the Struise farm from a 75cl bottle.  Both tastings had a hazy orange/apricot color.  From the tap though, the head just exploded with a superb creamy head that settles into a thin layer.  The bottled was a little more restrained than on tap.  The aroma was absolutely stunning with hints of oak, refreshing butter, honey, vanilla, and loads of mango and apricot; alcohol was well hidden for 10%abv.   Mouthfeel is medium bodied, great carbonation with no apparent alcohol.  The taste had chewy fruit notes with a malty character along with a touch of vanilla and oak; what an amazing complex brew.

First, I dont even know if this should be in the same class with other Imperial Stouts; it has its own distinctive style.  The appearance of this brew has to be one of the darkest stouts I have ever seen.  The head was so thick and velvety brown head that it looked like a shot of espressosuperb!  It had a magnificent scent of sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee beans and molasses along with roasted malt.  The taste is just out of this world.  Started off with a blitz of dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted malts; followed by light vanilla hoppy presence and fruit flavors with a touch of bitterness.  The mouthfeel wasnt too thick along with soft carbonation keeping the brew from tasting too syrupy.  The complexity of this brew is such that 13% ABV is totally absent until the glass is almost empty and then you begin to say Wow, this is one hell of a beer!  For me this was like drinking a fine Port that I could have sipped all night.  I cant say enough about the brews that are being produced at the Struise camp, but I do know that the rating of number one brewer in the world is without doubt; justified!

Flavor is a light cherry goodness, while remaining lightly vinous, lightly acidic, along with a light hint of wood; an exceptionally complex brew.   The balance of this stunning sour and intermixing of sweet and sour flavors, with an underlying hint of cherry is just superb!  Perfectly smooth light body and juicy funk to balance the sourness.

Pours a pitch-black espresso color topped with a thin foamy head settling fast to the rim.  Wow!!!!  What an aroma; the sweet oaky, vanilla fragrance leads the nose, sticky dark stone fruits with a touch of full-bodied ruby port, while the stouts mild roast-ness is softened to a silky smooth bitter chocolate-ness underneath.  Swirling the glass brings out underlying alcohol, but a Hell of lot milder than 11% suggests.  Smoothly balanced between sourness, sweetness, and oak; relatively little input of bitter roasted malts, along with being well-crafted and robust without being harsh at all.  The taste was incredible!!!  Sticky and oily sour-sweet dark-fruitiness, quickly followed by an aromatic mouthful of black/roasted malts in the form of leather, sweet coffee, chewy and bitter chocolates gradually the taste is taken over by a delicately vanillas note of cigar and charred-woodchips aftertaste lingering at the back of the palate.  The overall structure of the flavor profile evolves all the time...Got to love this brew!!!  ""Silky Smooth"" is not strong enough to describe the superb mouth feel of this beer.  This beer will be at the top of my list of favorites.  Again, thanks Mes for this magnificent brew; I Need More!!!
