I first purchased this item in the bottle upon release and drank it that night. I liked it then but had no idea what a little time would do for this beer. The most surprising aspect is the aromas and flavors of smoke. Not quite as strong as Rachbier but present nonetheless. Heavy dark, bitter chocolate notes as well. Dark in color with a nice brown hued head. The mouthfeel is exactly where I like a stout to be: heavy but not motoroil heavy, with nice carbonation. I think this beer will age like a champ and reward whomever can wait to drink this fine brew.    ",99.524,sparksjustin,California,9.2%,Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary Fritz & Kens Ale

All of their beers have a distinct aroma and taste that easily sets them apart and the Noel is no exception. Complex aromas of barnyard and spice. Dark but not pitch black in color. The taste is definitely influenced by the barrel fermentation that anyone who has some experience with wine will notice. But just as barrel fermentation  adds character and complexity to wine so too does it add complexity to all Jolly Pumpkin brews. Thats not to say that these are overly vanilla sweetened bourbon barrels that can kill a beers flavor. The holiday spices blend harmoniously with the barrel complexities that make this a welcome change to the heavily spiced and sweet holiday brews found at other breweries. ,97.538,sparksjustin,Michigan,9%,Jolly Pumpkin Noel de Calabaza
