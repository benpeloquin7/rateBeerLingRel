Drank this from a tulip pint glass and got little nose at all. Has the beginnings of an Imperial stout but no finish. Alcohol is not strong. There is no single hit of flavor, but is it not well balanced either, just dull.  Tastes like it was left in the glass a bit to long and lost its flavor. Sams Wine and Spirits Downers Grove, IL.

We were # 3,500 or so in the line so we didnt get any DLRIS.  This is a sipper for me, as it warms particularly.  Too tough for me to finish even the 6-7 ounces that cost $5. I would not buy it but am glad to have added it to the tasyed list. ",,Jorex,Indiana,15%,Three Floyds Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel Aged)
