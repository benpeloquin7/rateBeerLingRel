Unfortunately, this one is not one of the best I&apos;ve had.
Not much of a pumpkin nose or palate, but nicely smoked, with spices.
I wouldn&apos;t pay the $9 for a bottle again, but I don&apos;t hate myself for trying it as I&apos;ve done with some.

I doubt Guadalupe Brewing actually threw apple pies into the wort for this beer, but the effect is quite nice, and not overdone, IMO.
Nice nose of (you guessed it) apple pie, with a nice wheat beer finish.
I&apos;d buy this again; good summer beer. Would actually be really good with vanilla ice cream.
