Lovely purple Color with a creamy foam.
Smell of blueberrys, red currant and lacto. 
Taste like a fruit yoghurt some would say, loads of blueberrys and lacto. Very well balanced beween the sour notes and the fruit. Pretty similar to a Florida weisse.  ",,Balderbitch,Sweden,3%,Dragos / MankerBeer Lacto Lact And The Funky Bunch

Almost like motor oil.
Smell is heavly of cineamon and a tad of bourbon. 
Taste is sweet, but the cineamon takes over fast and the bourbon plays out well adding a vanilla taste with the oak and ends in a bitter dark chocolate feel. 
Feel is excelent, very smooth even it the flavours is so heavy
Overall a well executed beer, extreme balance considering all the things hapening in the beer. Would drink any day. 

Only minus is because of the head and that the cineamon was so heavy in the aroma. Which is pretty much good things.  ",,Balderbitch,Florida,10.4%,Cycle Pallet 1

Appearance: A golden beer that is incredibly foggy. Not surprising given that it is wheat in the beer. Huge bubbles lift to the top and a large snow-white head disappears very quickly. It almost crackled on the beer and Im getting a little affraid that I got an infected bottle.

Aroma: In the aroma I cannot feel anything that point out an infection, but it continues to crackle loudly. The aroma for me is striking of yuzu, although it should not be in the beer, and a very pleasant aroma of pineapple, grapefruit and passion fruit.

Taste: Extremely good! In the beginning, it is not unlike the old Swedish soft drink Loranga when it is far too fizzy and very juicy. Is not infected, it is just over carbonated. 
The taste is like drinking tropical juice. Enormous taste of tropical fruits, yuzu, pineapple, peach and passion fruit as icing on the cake before it is slowly released in the beginning of a fruity acid to a milky acid. Tartish. ",96.535,Balderbitch,Florida,4.6%,Angry Chair 3 Little Birds
