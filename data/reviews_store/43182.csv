The aroma just jumps out of the glass, with some of the richest and most intense notes of vanilla, caramel, oak, and chocolate I have ever encountered in a beer.  Really this smells more like an awesome dessert than beer.  Theres a little bourbon floating around in the nose too, but well placed amongst the other and more intense qualities.  I could linger on the aroma all day and not get tired of this one.  Flavor is equally impressive, with more intense chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and a hint of bourbon.
