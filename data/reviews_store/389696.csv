Much paler, almost greenish in colour, not much foam, more carbonation and more bitter. Not at all what I had expected and I honestly found the colour rather unappetising, but still a decent beer.

I am not sure if this bottle has gone bad, but with a best before date in 2027, it still ought to be good (brewed 2012).

When opening the bottle, the beer presents itself with an overwhelming, unpleasant yeasty smell, masking any other aroma. After pouring and letting the beer breathe for a while, the yeasty smell retracts and leaves room for something reminding me very much of burnt plastic.

The appearance is a very dark, reddish brown, with just a slight rim of foam, almost no carbonation.

It is very hard to describe the taste. The beer is so sour, that it is difficult to notice much more than a slight hint of alcohol. ",99.788,jarnbjo,Norway,16%,Ngne  / Mikkeller / Brewdog Horizon Tokyo Black
