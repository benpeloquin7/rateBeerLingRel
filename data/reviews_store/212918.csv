Delicious! This brew goes great with anything  anywhere, anytime. Smooth, crisp and very, VERY drinkable. Why do you want to force a beer down? This just disappears. The only real true american lager. Love that light bitter aftertaste that follows the slightly sweet but very light fruit flavor. Superb blend of all important components. My all time favorite by a long shot. Its easy to see why this stuff sells. ",0.147,eds1275,Missouri,5%,Budweiser
