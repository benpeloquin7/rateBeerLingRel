Pours well with attractive appearance. You hope for the nostalgia of what you believed it used to taste like and at first found it crisp and refreshing. As I made my way through the drink its essential blandness in a bottle is revealed Perfectly respectable unexciting effort that can touch a thirst, but not perhaps the emotions.

Flat and off putting. wondered whether to bother to drink it or  pour away. First sip was not inspiring and still disconcerted by appearance. Fortunately was eating some spiceful food and found palatable quenching the heat. Pretty mediocre effort but when paying a pound for a bottle you take your chances. ,23.203,DT_s,England,3.8%,Wentworth Imperial Ale
