Carlton took it over and down graded it a bit.
Carlton are trying their utmost to discontinue brewing this tasty beer.
Apparently it comes out of the vat first and has a nice brown colour.
Carlton brews in general (VB, Carlton etc) are all wish you- washy.
Carlton should not have been allowed across the river. They make Fosters too which no one in Australia drinks. ",11.189,Paddocks,Australia,4.4%,Kent Old Brown
