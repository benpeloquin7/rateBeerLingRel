I generally dont care for bourbon barrel aged anything. However, living in Chicago, and having as many liquor stores in my area who offered this to me early, I had to get as many as I could. Some will be sent to friends across the country in exchange for their local wares. I was surprised how much I liked this beer. The aroma is definitely bourbon-barrel aged. The stout appearance is undeniable, including the head. The taste is bourbon-esque, but it is sweet enough to win over beer-heads like me. It goes down smooth enough for me to double-take when I realized that I had two big mouthfuls left. Where did it go?? Im smiling as I write this... the 14.3% is definitely in effect, but not affecting my judgement. This is good beer. Overpriced? Probably. Delicious? Definitely. May have to reconsider what I ask for in compensation for my friends local beers. :) ",,Johntgrace,Illinois,14.2%,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout

This beer pours somewhere between a dirty yellow and orange, with a light and active head. You can smell the citra hop when you put your pint glass to your mouth, but the scent is intriguing and not all in your face. Perfectly balanced between an IPA and a pale ale, this beer is worth searching for, trading for, and flaunting in the face of your non-Chicago area friends. If you see it, get it. You wont be disappointed. ",99.894,Johntgrace,Indiana,6.2%,Three Floyds Zombie Dust
