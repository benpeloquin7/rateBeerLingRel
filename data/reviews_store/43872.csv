Stumbled upon it one day in Vermont. Now, when in Vermont and when we are near Middlebury, we go and stop by the brewery. This brewery is also owned by Wolavers, but they still keep the beers separate (for now.) 

One wish is that they would promote more in New Jersey and keep the beer fresh on tap and in bottles on the shelf (rotate your stock lease.)

We go out of our way for this beer. It was the first beer I had after 6+ months over in the sandbox and was happy to have it. ",42.057,ilikebier,Vermont,5%,Otter Creek Copper Ale
