Wow... Pours nice and dark. Deep, darkbrown with a slight red undertone in the sunlighht. Nice, full head that just barely ran down the side of the glass. Aroma is a sweet hoppiness with strong dark-roasted grain.  Brings a smile. Flavor is deep and slightly sweet- very rich and goes down creamy. A real pleasure to drink. Ill keep one of these on hand for the permanent grin effect. ",98.78,BigSkyBeerGuy,California,8.1%,Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout

Poured very nicely with a light golden head with good staying power. Aroma was faintly hoppy with some maltiness- not overpowering. Very nice medium amber tint. Flavor was slighly malty with the hops adding a nice finish as this beverage travelled smoothly down my throat. The hops tended to hang around a bit at the end providing a pleasant experience. This is a good one for all occasions ,42.057,BigSkyBeerGuy,Washington,5.8%,Redhook ESB

I really couldnt pick up the aroma that well. Perhaps slightly malty with very little hop fragrance. The clor was a light amber with a decent head on it. The taste was simply OK to me. The slightly malty aroma continued on the palate with minimal hoppiness.  There was a slight citrus taste. I will say it down very smooth despite heavy carbonation. This would be an OK one in the summer- not very heavy. ,43.524,BigSkyBeerGuy,Colorado,5.2%,New Belgium Fat Tire

Brings back memories. Nice big head fit great in a traditional Weizenbier glass. Cloudy amber in color. The aroma reminded me a little bit of a nice bourbon with vanilla or fruit undertones. Taste was a little disappointing as it only slightly matched the aroma, but still refreshing- lighter than it looks. Nice trip down memeory lane.

When poured the head was minimal, but there. Good aroma of hops and I thought a little caramel. The head was the only thing keeping this from being a 5 as the color was a perfect reddish amber. Very nice. The flavor started hoppy but gave way to a pleasant slightly smokey malt flavor that hung around for awhile. A good one to have around for Amber lovers.

They called it by their own name, but it was still Beltian White. Served with an orage, but I set it aside initially. Nice white head topped this cloudy light gold nectar. Aroma was slightly citrus with some spice. Taste was OK, but did not finish well in my opinion- it just kind of disappeared. Adding the orange back in enhanced the aroma, but really did nothing for the taste. Good on a summer day, but I prefer something with more body.
