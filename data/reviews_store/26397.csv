It is really light, bubbly and crisp.  Apple flavor is not overpowering and doesnt leave a bad aftertaste.  It has just the right amount of carbonation.  I like ciders, but usually cannot drink more than one because they are generally too sweet.  Thats not the case with Wynkoops Western Slope Cider.  Its not nearly as sweet as a Woodchuck or Woodpecker. ",46.365,jlf,Colorado,5.25%,Wynkoop Western Slope Cider
