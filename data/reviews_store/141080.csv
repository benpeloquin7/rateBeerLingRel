This brew has surpassed my expectations from the genesis of my indulgence.  Great citrus aroma and high powered hop formula outlasts the best of them.  Goes great with a late meal or can substitute as a meal itself.  Super clean and high powered ABV keeps my chippy close.

Very light for a Vanilla Porter.  Nice tones of caramel and chocolate, but lacks the viscous properties that make the vanilla porter stand out.  ABV is tolerable, but would like to see an aggressive makeover for next year.  Maybe using some ginger roots or coacoa beans for added depth and complexity.

Needs a little more citrusy nose for it to compliment spicy food or satisfy that hop-fetish seeker.  Overall good ABV and CAN stand up to some of its local rivals like Sierra Nevada and Green Flash. ,97.538,SuperRBowers,California,9%,Knee Deep Hoptologist DIPA
