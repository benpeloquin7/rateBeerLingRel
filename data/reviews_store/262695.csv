Smells heavily of scotch - peat and smoke prevalent. Taste is very heavy smoke, a bit of peat, and strong alcohol finish. Overall, good brew, aged very well, but Ill likely tire of it by the end of the 750ml bottle since Im not sharing. ",93.33,thecp015,Missouri,10.2%,Schlafly 21st Anniversary Single Malt Scottish Ale

Citrus, resin, grass. Very sweet linger. Appearance: deep copper with this head that fades quickly. Taste strong hops, both citrus and bitter, quickly giving way to a strong malt heft and sweetness. Palate: balanced, neither too thick or too thin. Overall, very good beer that unfortunately isnt here to stay. ",99.63,thecp015,California,10.8%,Stone RuinTen IPA
