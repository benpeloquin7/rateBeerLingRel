Jet black, pours similar to their oatmeal stout. The aroma was good, but I felt as though their couldve been more of it. (And yes I did use the right glass)
The taste was outstanding. Coffee, cocoa, vanilla and the bourbon were very upfront. The bourbon I found added a sort of sweetness to this brew, and usually I dont like sweet beer, but this time it fit just right.
Extremely malty and full bodied, heavy, very warming.
They said they used cascade, goldings and willamette, the cascade was the aroma, the goldings was for flavor, but took the back seat, and the willamette was the dominant hop.
Overall an outstanding brew, too bad their wont be anymore. Ill age the other 5 bottles I have and right another review in a year. ",99.577,beerandweed,Canada,9.2%,St. Ambroise Stout Impriale Russe
