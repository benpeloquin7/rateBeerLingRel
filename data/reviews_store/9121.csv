I asked for the local brew and for the first time in my life I had a Guinness. I have never had a beer moment quite like that. It was almost a religous experience. From that day Guinness has always been my favorate tap. My rating here is for Tap Guinness only. canned and bottle would rate slighty lower  ,80.547,boatswains,Ireland,4.2%,Guinness Draught
