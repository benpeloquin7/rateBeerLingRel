No strong bite, goes down easy, not hoppy at all. Would recommend this to friends who are not avid beer drinkers and avoid dark beers in general.

Great hop flavor, not too strong. Great full body taste with earthy flavors. Very carbonated with a small bite. Happy to taste the beer, but very sad it was gone.

Goes down easy, don&apos;t notice too much flavor. There is a nice bite (not strong), and the carbonation is in the low to mid range.

Beer tastes slightly more carbonated than some lagers, but the water down taste is very present. For Pils, this seems to be on the low end for flavor seekers. For American pils, I guess it hits the mark. Not my choice for relaxing from a long days of work, but it would be a great choice for beer pong.

When drinking it, flavors are coming at you all at once. Mouth is left with a full body feeling. There is a slight froth-like feel, but it is overpowered by the light bite of the beer. Overall, great beer with hazelnut flavor (if you are into that kind of thing).
