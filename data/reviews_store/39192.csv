The price is the only thing enticing. Has a horrid after taste and a tinny initial flavor. Pours out with a decent enough look, but smells like hell. Treat yourself and spend an extra couple of bucks on something that is drinkable. ",0.441,ragincanadian,Canada,5%,Laker Lager

A little light for my taste but this ale pairs extremely well with a fine steak or a lowly burger. Great fruity taste and has great drinkability. ,32.996,ragincanadian,Canada,5%,Camerons Cosmic Cream Ale
