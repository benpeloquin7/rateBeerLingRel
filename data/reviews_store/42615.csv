Pours pitch black with a tan head that sticks around (surprise). Lots of lacing on the way down as well. Nose is strong with wood tones. Sweet wood tones. Flavor is intense. The wood thats in this is so deep, its not just proper to say its wood. This is the living wood that rests well below the bark of the aged trees you might find. Almost a berry tone to it as well.
