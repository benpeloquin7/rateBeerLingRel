At 2.99 a 6pk, I had a pretty good idea what to expect, but I tried it anyways. Reminded me of Milwaukees best at first. Choked down the 1st can. The thing is, the more I drink it, the more I like it. It grows on you. Pours golden, with a pretty good head. I am having one right now as I write.(no, this is my 1st of the night so Im not drunk). Is it the best beer out there? No. But give it a chance and Im sure it will grow on you. And at 2.99 a 6pk, it willstill get the job done on a budget.
