Rating beer is a curious affair- so much is dependent upon ones mood, general mindset and other extraneous factors that invariably have nothing to do with the beer in question. I have variously rated beers when I have been stuffed up, pleasantly tired, hot and bothered and philosophically relaxed. That I was in the perfect mood to appreciate a beer as well done as the KBS was perhaps something to be truly thankful for- at the end of a long day, having worked out, read a tremendous amount and finished up a number of things on my to-do list, the KBS presented the ideal nightcap. Onwards to the beer...it pours a glutinous black w/ a sizzling tan head that rapidly diminishes into some minimal lacing; aroma has the characteristically incredible three-coffee profile of the regular Breakfast Stout- the sheer richness and depth of the coffee aroma cannot be expressed in mere words. It is complemented nicely by vanilla (from the Oak I suspect) and Bourbon notes, along w/ hints of the other Breakfast Stout aromas, albeit to a lesser degree; flavor is sweet and malty w/ stronger chocolate than in the aroma, more of that coffee and burnt sugar...ends on the coffee note w/ a bourbon burn towards the back of ones throat.

Has there ever been any other beer with this much of an aura surrounding it? Yet, it managed to meet the hype and go one step further.

Pours a viscous black motor oil that sticks like grease to the sides of the glass as you swill it- this one left a thick stain on my finger nail. Deep Sienna head that diminishes fairly quickly to release a complex nose of chocolate dried fruit, liquorish (very evident!), raisins, coffee and what have you. The flavor does the aroma due justice. Mouthfeel is full and thick, yet it goes down very easily.
