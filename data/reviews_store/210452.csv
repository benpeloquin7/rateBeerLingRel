The peach flavour makes it stand out, and fits incredibly well with the beer. Its not a cheap sodalike aroma, but rather a sweet but light finish after each slurp. Otherwise the beer has a medium heavyness to it that is both floral and woodlike. Really unique beer. I only wish it was just a tad stronger like 6%.
