The hoppy bitterness is present but subdued, fine tuned. Lighter bodied but has a refreshing full flavored mouthfeel. Finishes on a bitter grapefruit note. All around just a delicious ale, I will be buying this again! ",56.738,eRock_2013,New York,5.6%,HeBrew Genesis Dry Hopped Session Ale

Aroma is a bit more classic and pleasant, with light grassy noble hops, some bready malt, fresh and light. On the palate, this pils is strikingly thin, very watery in an unpleasant way. On the other hand, the flavor is a more well done pils profile, with bitter noble hops and a sweetbread pale malt balance. An ok beer overall, but not highly recommended. Reminded me of Stella Artois, but I would prefer the latter. ",14.27,eRock_2013,Germany,4.8%,Kaiserdom Pilsener

From a growler fresh from the brewery 20 minutes down the road, this Porter poured a chocolately brown color, with an eggshell off-white head, moderate lacing, standard for the style. The aroma though hits you before the appearance, with a strong chocolately and vanilla aroma, almost like a sweet dessert. Forward taste of milk chocolate and vanilla bean in the flavor, but this is however certainly not a dessert beer, as there is a roasty and nutty malt base underneath that provides a balancing contrast. Medium bodied and smooth with lesser carbonation, very drinkable, with a cocoa finish. Quite distinctive, excellent complexity, well done!  ",,eRock_2013,South Carolina,6%,River Rat Lost Port Porter

On tap down in Cola SC, this ESB pours a dark amber color, reminiscent of maple syrup (the color not the viscosity!) moderate white head, stays frothy. Aroma of caramel malt herbal hops, toffee. Taste is very nutty, malty and also some bitter hops. Medium-bodied, earthy finish, all around just a pleasant and tasty ale. Not quite as good as Oysterhouse&apos;s ESB but a close second. I would definitely drink this again. ",59.765,eRock_2013,North Carolina,5.5%,Green Man ESB
