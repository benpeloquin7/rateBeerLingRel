It came out from a tap as pale, hazy, with white foam on top.  It does taste bitter, without much floral overtones, mostly bitter and slightly herbal.  It has medium body, and it finishes bitter, but its easy to drink.

Had on tap at Drift Inn after soaring over St. Perpetua Trail in the light rain. ",93.395,Dea_Latis,Oregon,6.7%,Terminal Gravity IPA
