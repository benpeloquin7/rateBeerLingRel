A noted scoundrel and raconteur of a beer, drinking one is a bold statement.  Notoriously difficult to find outside of Vancouver Island, it has a sweet taste and is drinkable at any temperature.  Despite the persistent rumour that there is a drop of honey in every can, Lucky is pound for pound the toughest beer served in the 355ml format.  Best enjoyed with friends.  Drink up.
