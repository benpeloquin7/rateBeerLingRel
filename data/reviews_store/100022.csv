I was working at village bottle shop and my manager broke the neck off one of the 4 bottles we had on accident. The break was perfect. None of the beer spilled and it didnt get into the beer. I poured the remaining into a nalgene bottle and saved it until I got home for a more proper tasting. I like this beer because they are pushing the envelope and just the idea of what beer is and can be. No head at all completely no carbonation. Lots of molasses and caramelized sugars. Alcohol presence heavy, very very warming. It would make for a nice beer to enjoy during the heart of winter with good friends.  ",99.788,tippebrewcrew2,Massachusetts,27%,Samuel Adams Utopias
