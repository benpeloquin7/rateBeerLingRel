Opens with a pop and pours lively with a big fluffy head that has good retention and leaves a lot of lace.

Looks cloudy once the carbonation wears off and even with the yeast dumped into a shot glass there is some sediment swirling around.

The aroma has a an off grapefruit smell and caramel. 

Mouthfeel reminds me of seeking good flavor in a plump cloud. Long lasting and filling but surprisingly tasty with banana and caramel combos.
