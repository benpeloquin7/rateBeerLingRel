Absolutely no head to speak of, but there was still a lively carbonation left for the tongue and mouth.  Beer was a murky tea brown, with a few yeast floaties present.  Aroma was pleasantly malty and full of caramel, with just a wisp of alcohol to remind you of its strength.  Taste was a composite of malty sweetness, mixed with warming alcohol; the end is surprisingly bitter - but I was not sure if this was due to yeast bite or hops.  Overall I was impressed, although the alcoholic taste and strength detracted fom the experience.  I would like to try a bottle that was a bit less long in the tooth.

Appearance was deep-red, with just a hint of chocolate brown at the edges of my glass; nice tan head with staying power.  The warming effects of alcohol were clearly evident, but not offensive due to a nice relaxing level of carbonation.  I have a hard time pinpointing the taste components of this brew - definitely chocolate and earth flavors, but there is something elusive.  Quite an enjoyable brew, definitely don't want to compound this hummer with others due to its kick! ",99.365,tswhitehead,Alaska,11.5%,Midnight Sun Monks Mistress

No, butterscotch seems more appropriate.  The appearance is a near flawless deep copper, with a minimal head, but nice lacework. The flavor is a combination of maltiness and butterscotch, with a subdued hoppiness at the end.  The flavor seems to go on without end.  The palate is buttery smooth and lively.

Mouthfeel was slightly slick and pleasantly spritzy.  Taste was a mix of cream corn and slight maltiness, with a nice drying bitterness which tailed a bit in the throat.  The color was a typical pale gold as found in other similar beers.  I would buy again if put to it. ",38.866,tswhitehead,Germany,4.9%,Paulaner Original Mnchner Hell (Premium Lager)
