As expected, this was very similar to Harp, but a bit hoppier.  It had a slightly crisper, more American flavor profile.  It certainly did its job, but didnt blow me out of the water; it ends up tasting a bit thin and has a somewhat dry mouthfeel.   ",39.025,bwp116,Oregon,5%,Rogue Irish Style Lager
