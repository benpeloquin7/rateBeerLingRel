FIRST tried drinking from snifter (as i do ALL Belgians), VERY lackluster on ALL counts. Now, Ive NEVER been a big ""the glass makes the beer"" follower, but on my LAST bottle, tried in a tulip Sam Adams glass and was shocked at the difference, was like a totally different beer on all counts. Will I buy again, no....but I NOW am a firm believer in the addage that the right glass DOES make or BREAK the beer ",98.244,buckaroobanzai,Belgium,8.5%,Duvel

And i anxiously wait every fall for pumpkin to make its appearance (Great Pumkin Charlie Brown). Sadly to my chagrin, i was anything BUT impressed: aroma and taste, the pumpkin was BARELY apparent and again HIGHLY disappointed, appearance, ok, but nothing to write home about. Sticking to my guns, BEST pumpkin beer (that Ive had to date) BY FAR for taste, value, and ABV, make mine Schlafly Pumpkin!! ",97.262,buckaroobanzai,New York,8.6%,Southern Tier Pumking

Pours out hazy straw-yellow with lacy white head. Was PLEASANTLY surprised as thick as this beer appeared in the snifter (isnt that the ONLY way to drink great beers?) that it was lighter than expected but did NOT hold back on any flavor. VERY reminicent of a farmhouse ale (only not QUITE as light or hoppy)
This brewery is CONSTANTLY amazing me and I recommend them often! ",96.136,buckaroobanzai,Canada,9%,Unibroue Don de Dieu

Have cellared SIX 2008 vintage, 3 09, 3 10 and so on comparing and contrasting. Have to say at 6 years, the 08 is SMOOTH as SILK and utterly DELICIOUS! Notes of caramel and toffee wafting from the snifter as I imbibed on New Years day. Compared to a 2010 and AMAZINGLY, with the SAME formula, the NOTES were DRASTICALLY different....almost TROPICAL!! Coconut, Papaya and Mango very forward, but STILL with the smoothness consistancy that Ive come to EXPECT from Schlafly. Cant wait till my B.D. in September to compare/contrast again!!!

(granted, living in a rural community, not a TON of varieties to compare, BUT, this beer, for me HAS a LOT going for it! Pours out thick and slow with little tan-ish head that disappears quickly. On the nose, HEAVY cocoa with the stout as a backnote. On the TASTE however the EXACT opposite, the stout comes through, smooth and easy, the chocolate as a DELICIOUS after taste! Very smooth and not overwhelming at all with the alcohol. A definite favorite. Have been curious on cellaring a four pack for a couple years to see how it ages.....
