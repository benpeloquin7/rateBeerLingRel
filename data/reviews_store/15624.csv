Tried this beer on the night of the CASK club meeting, October 8.  I mostly wanted to see how my own homebrewed alt stacked up against it.  A clear, brown beer with a white head and sweet malty aroma. It was malty and a bit sweet, with a crisp sharpness.  I concluded yet again that my own brew was superior, with a more delicate chocolate malt flavor.  Of course all home brewers think their own brews are the best..   Overall a good brew but not great.
