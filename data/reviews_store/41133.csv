Sweet smell hits you as soon as you pour it.  

Strong alcohol warmth, but its balanced by a sturdy hop taste.  The hop bitterness hit me before the malt sweetness, but it certainly wasnt overwhelming.  Tasted a bit of raisin and definitely sugary syrup.  Above average carbonation, especially for a ""barley wine.""  

Overall decent complex tasting beer you cant necessarily afford to have too many of. ",99.365,hefegrizzly,Oregon,10%,Hair of the Dog Fred

The fruit scense of the hefeweizen shows through, with a lemon feel.  Overall a great beer, especially to enjor with a girlfriend. ",30.547,hefegrizzly,Germany,5.3%,Erdinger Weissbier Kristallklar
