Food Pairing: The bread crust-like malt flavour will match the sweet nuttiness of falafels (just go easy on the hot sauce) and the bubbly, hoppy finish will cut through its hummus and garlic sauce. Also welcome alongside most salads and white fish.

The Verdict: A refreshing, crisp lager. Especially recommended for Heineken and Grolsch lovers.
