Vigorous pour into a tulip glass produces a black opaque body under a decent light brown reverse-cascading head.

Smell of dark chocolate covered raisins, prunes, malty malt on malted malt.

Taste of intense sweet malt, chocolate malt, raisins, figs, charred apples(?), espresso, rye bread and pepper. Ridiculously intense.

Very drinkable for 11.5%. Wowow. Dangerous.

Overall, this is the most incredible beer for the money Ive ever had: at $2.50 for a 12-ounce bottle (= 20.83 cents per ounce), it is nearly as good as Dark Lord, which is $15 for 22 ounces (=68.2 cents per ounce).

The usual 22 ounce bomber, set out from cellaring and allowed to warm to about 55 degrees. Poured into St. Bernie tulip goblets, not light passes through this monster. Vigorous pour yielded a brown (with yellow edges?) large reverse cascading head that clung to the glass like molasses.

Smell of espresso, dark chocolate, burned cherry syrup, prunes, figs, and malted malt. Incredible: I just wanted to go on inhaling this aroma!

Taste is huge and chewy and tongue wrestlingly thick: this is like Yeti on steroid. Intensely decadent dark chocolate espresso malt with prunes and caramel and malt on malted-chocolate-covered-cherries. Took most of an hour to savour this: as it warmed, everything gets more intense, especially the chocolate.

Mouthfeel is the richest of any beer Ive ever had: simply decadently smooth and mouth-fillingly round. You want to swirl this stuff, not swallow it.

Drinkability is the only thing that hold this back. Wierd thing is that all the intensely enormous voluptuousness of the flavors and mouthfeel completely mask the 13.0%. Perilously drinkable.

A note: reserved the bottom half-inch to consume by itself. The 2005, unlike the 2004, doesnt have a lot of sludge at the bottom. However, there was a lot of flavor: that last half-inch was like the rest of the bottle concentrated into two small mouthfulls -- absolutely over the top.

Overall, a freakishly amazing brew, and I can see why people are after this with abandon. Thanks again to Crosling for the sharing! Astonishing.

Red Biddy is completely unique -- its filtered through local bog-myrtle!
Its a gorgeous cloudy light red-brown amber (""Like a roan horse,"" said my daughter), with a creamy off-white fully-lasting head and excellent lacing.
The aroma is floral, herb, orange, with a back note of coriander and heather or currant. ""Like an herbal tea,"" said my son.
Things dropped off a bit in the tasting -- rather less vigorous than I would have expected from the looks and smell, but really quite pleasant nonetheless. Nice light malt mixes with moderately bitter hops with an average acidic finish.

Melt-in-your-mouth smoothness and blend of the flavors, so theres not one dominant highnote -- just a kind of smooth harmony of rich dark tastes.
Very smooth and drinkable for a Belgian Dark Ale, and oh, so available here in Colorado. If you havent had some, pick up a case next time youre through the prettiest state in the USA, which happens to have a lot of really great beers.
By the way, though not significant, the bottle I poured tonight read ABV of 5.6%. And . . . did I mention its smooth?

Collins, CO.
Appearance: Nice rusty amber, with a two-finger head that reduced to one finger and remained the whole drink.
Smell: Sharp hops foreground with a biscuit malt presence. A slight hint of gingerand pepper, perhaps. Nice.
Taste: Starts with a crisp sharp hoppiness with a smooth malt undertow, none of the spiceyness of the smell. Pretty good stuff.
Mouthfeel: Clean, round and smooth, more presence than one might anticipate from an amber ale.
Dinrkability: Perhaps a bit too much carbonation to drink several. Nice enough for a couple.
Overall, I think this beer is better on draught than bottled. Drinking it three miles from where it was put in the keg didnt hurt, Im sure. I know people who rave over this beer. My son and I (who turned 21 today!) both thought it was pretty good, but nothing to rave about.

Brewed with Pale, Aromatic, C-40 and Carapils malts, all fairly lightly-toasted. Willamette, Cascade and Magnum hops are very much kept in abeyance here, with only 18 IBU. The malts dominate the smell and the taste.
Unpasteurized (as all of this breweries ales are!), unfiltered. bottle-conditioned spring ale on its first run of the season .
Semi-cloudy, orange-colored pretty looking beer.
Notes of orange and lemon in the nose, with wheat and maybe even oats. Taste matches, but lays a bit lower than the smell.

I wish I could tell when this one was bottled, since its truly a ""live"" beer that matures and ripens. Anyway, however ripe this one was, it would be hard to imagine it getting any better with age.
Beautiful dark red-brown pour, with an incredible tan head that lasted well; and yet it kept a nice carbonation throughout. Rich, almost warm smells of baked figs(?) and malt.
Really an adventure in beer: all that malt and all that wheat, and hardly any hops -- just the way I like it. A kind of nutty, unsweetened cocoa; a hint of raspberry; some smoke: a ton of flavor mixed in a very smoooth nectar with an almost clove-like finish.
I loved the last bit -- followed the instructions I was given and left a couple ounces in the bottom and swirled it at the end to pick up the yeast -- what an amazing flavor that was!
Overall, this is definitely a massive ""WOW!"" beer! One to savor. 500ml bottle definitely worth the $2.79 price!! I only wish Id bought ten! ",99.63,ColoradoBobs,Germany,8.2%,Schneider Weisse Aventinus

Opened the bottle at approximately 45 degrees F. Perhaps a bit too warm?
Pours a lovely dark, almost opaque mahogany red-brown with a smooth tan two-finger head, that turns bumpy and thick and quickly diminishes to a small ring. Minimal lacing.
First smell is of raisins, coffee, chocolate and some sugar: warm and inviting. A very rich aroma.
First taste is rich, dark malt, and very very smoooth.  By mid-glass, some of the spicey underflavors have come up. The taste takes on a clove almost peppery set. Long chocolatey, peppery, clovey aftertaste. Mmmm. Im sure there are some hops in there somewhere, but theyre well in the background -- just where I like them.
So silky in the mouth -- you want to roll it around a bit.

Mix chocolate, raisins  & rye bread rising just before it goes in the oven. Wow!  Amazing taste. Very unexpected! Not the flavor I had expected from the color. Raisin, plum, yeast, a ripe banana note, high note of pineapple, but not overly sweet. My friend, who shared part of this bottle said, ""Like baked raisins with all the sugar turned into alcohol."" Not much of the toasted malt or chocolate tastes I had been expecting -- just a total and wonderful surprise!  What a rich, round feel! The bottle said to serve this at 52 to 56 degrees F., and that was right! Smooth without being syrupy -- I hardly wanted to swallow this, it was so nice in the mouth.
