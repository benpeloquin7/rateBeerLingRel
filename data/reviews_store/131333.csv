Advertisement 4-bottle pack including their Witbier ( 5,49). Kstritzer belong to the Bitburger group, so this may be one of the first ventures by a big player in Germany (Strtebeker and Ratsherrn being other, yet smaller examples), putting affordable, hitherto unknown styles in supermarkets, in an attempt not to miss the ever-accelerating craft beer train which has been put in motion by German microbreweries, who took their cue from abroad. Other bigger German brewers (BrauFactum/Oetker, Riegele) market their craft beers as luxury items in fancy bottles for ridiculous prices. Some breweries try to appear original by inventing new names for styles that arent new (see Maisel&Friends; Indian Ale, an IPA, or Chocolate Bock, a stout). Yet other brewers dont even bother trying to persuade the regular German beer drinker, who typically sticks to his local Pils, and make their more interesting brews available only abroad (Bayerischer Bahnhof exports to the US, for example). 

Maybe the stubborn adherence to the Reinheitsgebot wasnt such a good idea after all. Now German brewers, facing an increasing demand for tasteful beer, resort to copying American and Belgian styles, waking up to the fact that they have long been surpassed in terms of variety and creativity. Reading their current brochures and websites, which present beers like IPA as an exciting, novel beer style - when the rest of the world has been brewing and drinking it for centuries - is quite amusing. 

Anyway, back to the beer. Although it is called Pale Ale, it is in fact an IPA, according to the brewers deScription on their website (and its taste, of course). So, the ratebeer categorization is correct. The beer develops a frothy, off-white head that slowly dissipates, leaving good lacing. The color is a hazy, nicely glowing amber-orange, carbonation is soft, aroma is of the true-to-style citrus/grapefruit variety. Sips feel moderately oily, a light sweetness at the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to a pronounced bitterness that lingers for a long finish. 

This is a good IPA, surprisingly so for a first try. The aforementioned regular German beer drinker will find it almost too powerful and different. After all, monopolist brewers insistence on what they call drinkability in their Pilsener style beers has accustomed many Germans to uncomplainingly accept an approximation of water for decades. One must envy those unsuspecting folks who still have so many great beers ahead of them to discover. This one is a good start. ",85.276,beerbert,Germany,7%,Kstritzer Meisterwerke Pale Ale
