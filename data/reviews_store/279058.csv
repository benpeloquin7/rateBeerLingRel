This is quite something. Pale copper colour, with a fairly pungent, grassy hops aroma. The flavour is dominated by an intense green tea astringency, but with the benefit of some sweet citrus, passionfruit, pine resin and pale malt flavours making it a complex brew with plenty of impact. The balance of the astringency and the sweet fruitiness makes you keep coming back for more, despite the full hops assault on the taste buds. Impressive.

The aroma is fairly subdued, with some fruity hops and a range of mild malty notes. The palate is dominated by the malt sweetness, with an abundance of mango, passionfruit and banana tropical fruit flavours and phenolics, balanced with a mid to light dose of well integrated hops bitterness that tempers the richness and alcohol. There are also hints of chocolate malt, raisin and prune, which are likely to develop over time. Velvety smooth texture. A very appealing beer. ",84.722,SAChubb,New Zealand,7.5%,Tuatara Dubbel

The aroma is fairly subdued, although there is some fresh hops and an earthy character coming through. The initial taste is dominated by the pungent hops flavor (that will be the whole cone Nelson Sauvin hops), but before too long the caramelized sugar and toffee flavours come to the fore, with a good amount of pungent hops bitterness and a slightly funky, almost mushroomy taste on the finish. The texture is smooth, with a velvety, rich mouthfeel. If you like your beers to have a good amount of bitterness but also some sweet caramel malt flavor, this is the beer for you! I certainly enjoyed it. ",96.078,SAChubb,New Zealand,6.5%,Garage Project Red Rocks Reserve
