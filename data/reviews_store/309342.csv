A: Lighter than expected chestnut with a big dose of floaties but a prodigious 3-4 finger light beige head with decent retention and peaks of lacing.

S: Major fruity aroma here with fig, plums, red grapes, currants, bananas, and orange marmalade all combining with some mild herbal hopping to create a huge malt blast. The entire aroma experience is accentuated by further fruity yeast esters with a mild, phenolic, clove character

T: The flavor also assaults with malt, first with dark fruits like red and purple grapes, figs, cherries, plums, and raisins, all dosed with a heavy dose of rum-infused honey. Hops provide some balancing herbal-based bitterness. Yeast esters play a big role with banana and some lightly sulfuric apricot and peach character as well. Bitterness is low -- this is a malt wallop all the way, and a good one too. Vinous without getting wondery -- a masterful beer all-around. The alcohol is tame and in the background.

M: Silky smooth with nowhere the 12% detectable anywhere. Sumptuous feel overall with moderate carbonation to keep it from feeling too thick and viscous.

O: This was indeed a good one to put away -- wow -- huge dark fruit character with drinkability. ",97.428,cwill,Pennsylvania,12%,Victory V12
