The sugar masks the strength well and the top notes are reminiscent of coca-cola. There is an undertone of bark that creeps in after the initial hit. A dead cert for anyone wanting to try something out of the ordinary. ,,SometimesSean,England,10.5%,All Seeing Eye Machiavelli

Pours a nice hazy head with a citrusy aroma. Taste of tangerine jumps out, which may come from the sherry casks, and this is brought alive by the Brett, a lovely balance of sweet and sour. The texture is slighly syrupy, but with a nice fizz. Certainly looking forwards to the next batch. ",,SometimesSean,England,6.3%,All Seeing Eye Cest La Lumire
