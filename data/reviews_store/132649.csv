Light, slightly sweet with a mildly bitter finish. When served cellar temp (my preferred tasting temp), the unpleasant adjunct grain tastes typical of large breweries are overpowering though (rice and corn I believe). Decent as a cheaper beer as long as its served cold enough to deaden the palate a bit.  ",13.158,dantose,Missouri,5.2%,Shock Top Belgian White
