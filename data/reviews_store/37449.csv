To think that Sarajevsko has a much lower rating than this and is one of only 2 drinkable beers available in Bosnia of the local variety is a shame.  My friends and I drink this stuff only if were hammered already and dont care what were consuming or if its the only beer available.  Hopefully with the new ownership of this Brewery (some British company according to rumours) theyll be able to improve the quality of this garbage.  I was ""lucky"" enough  to tour the pivara and was fairly horrified by the number of dead pigeons and mice that littered the floor.  Yeah its Bosnia (or rather the Republika Srpska) but thats just a travesty. ",5.282,effguy,Bosnia,5%,Nektar Pivo
