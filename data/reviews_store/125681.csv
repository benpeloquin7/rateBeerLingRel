The Four pours a hazy reddish orange that glows like the sun against the light.  A huge vanilla colored head easily erects into a cloud-like froth.  It hangs around for several minutes and leaves thick lacing behind.  

The aroma starts mild, you really have to dip your nose into the glass to pick up its nuances.  It smells of sweet malts, light hops, and tons of fruity esters that remind me of bananas and tropical fruits.  There is the slightest hing of alcohol, too.  Once the head dissipates, though, the aromas really come alive.  

Palate is clean and full, with layers of flavors that arrange themselves perfectly.  I can feel it all over my tongue, mouth, lips, everywhere.  Theres a good amount of carbonation to keep things lively.  Malty flavors throughout, with medium hop bitterness, a little biscuit, toasted malt, dark fruits, and maybe some red currants.  Hints of butterscotch, too.  The beer finishes with a heavy malt presence, similar to a scotch ale or wee heavy.  The experience never shows the beers 10% ABV.  

This another great offering from Allagash.  A very flavorful, unique, drinkable beer.  Not a session beer, but it can go with or without food.  Its so heady in its appearance, aroma, palate, and taste.  Ill definitely buy a couple of bottles for the cellar.   ",98.459,ameltzer,Maine,10%,Allagash Four

The tannish-white head is short with big bubbles that rise slowly and disappear quickly.  The aroma is massive; full of dark fruits like figs and dates, backed by lots of earthy and floral hops.  Toast and burnt caramel are all over the aroma and flavor.  The taste is pleasantly fruity and complemented by toasted  malts and mild bitterness.  Finish is big and clean with hints of rye, and flowery hops.  A little more smokiness or oak would do well here.  This a great Scottish beer to sip on with some hearty pub fare.

It pours a golden honey color, with slight haziness when held to the light.   Its fluffy white head pours two easy fingers and hangs around for a while, leaving some thing lacing.  The huge aroma features blooming floral hops, sweet nectar, and loads of zesty pink grapefruit.  The taste starts off malty sweet with fruity hops and light caramel, then transitions into a long, bitter, full-bodied finish.  This beer really showcases the different aromas and flavors of its hops.  Also, it is such a sessionable beer youd never expect it weighs in at 7.2% ABV.
