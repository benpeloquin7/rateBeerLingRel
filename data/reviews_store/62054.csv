Halfway between an Old Ale and an IPA, with the good aspects of both.  Lots of alcohol but well masked in the flavor and not overly sweet.  Plenty of hops but well balanced by the malt.  This is also just about the strongest beer that sells for under $2 a bottle in Oregon.  Dangerous stuff, and highly recommended.

This was unlike any other beer I have ever had - there must have been a lot of bourbon left in those barrels!  Bourbon taste was just a bit too much for me to give it a perfect score, but otherwise a delicious brew. ",96.422,luminara,Oregon,10%,Block 15 Pappys Dark

Amazing brew - flavors of honey and raspberry with a slight Belgian yeastiness that is not at all overdone.  This goes straight to the top of my favorites list - up with Corsendonk Pale and Schell Einbecker Doppelbock (MN).  I could drink this all night... ,97.974,luminara,Canada,10%,Unibroue 16
