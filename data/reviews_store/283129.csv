Pumpkins are easy to mess up if the spices are not in balance. As is the case here. The nose is all Cinnamon. The flavor is extremely bland with an explosion of Cinnamon on the back of the tongue. Where is the nutmeg? The brown sugar? The Allspice? Hell, where is the freakin pumpkin? If you have a choice of another pumpkin over this one, take it.
