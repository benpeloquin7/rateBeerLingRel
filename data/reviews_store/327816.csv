It lacks a more unique flavor and aroma and sometimes comes across a bit blend. Bought the beer in a large bottle from a local shop. Beers in Thailand are usually served just above freezing point and that is definitely how this one should be enjoyed. Extra note: dont forget to tell Thai staff in local pubs NOT to add Ice to your Beer (as seems to be the custom in Thailand) ,5.428,fobia405,Thailand,5%,Chang Export
