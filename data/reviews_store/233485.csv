Nose is of candy peanuts peanut brittle liquory booze. Starts sweet and boost nutty in the middle and sweet coffee bitterness left in the mouth and tongue. Very nice grape fruity hook character balances and hides the 18% very well. Overall very good beer felt lucky when I found it after reading about it. Would drink again imagine it would become magical in time. ,97.974,EvilHenchman,Michigan,15%,Founders Backstage Series # 5: 15th Anniversary Bolt Cutter Barley Wine

Two fingers of head at the pour settles to a haze layer. Lots of booze hops and coffee on the tongue.  Finish is as stated but lingers with bitter coffee. Medium body. Moderately creamy probably from lactose addition. Very solid beer would drink again. ,99.312,EvilHenchman,Ohio,9%,Great Lakes Blackout Stout
