Comes in plastic bottle, 1.5l too. Aroma pretty pleasant rye breadish, appearance dark brown, lightly foamy, liquid, clear. Taste too light, mildly sweet and lightly citric, unusual and disappointingly misses naturality. Body very light, thin, watery texture, softly carbonated. Appearantly short, fast brewing process. Doesnt contain preservatives. But overall didnt met expectations considering the price paid. ",,Vykintas,Belarus,1.2%,Krinitsa Starazhytny Kvass
