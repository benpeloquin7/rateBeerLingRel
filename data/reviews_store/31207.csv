Consistency is very heavy, dark brown color with very little head.

Aroma is amazing combination of brandy, whiskey with subtle malt sweetness.

Flavor is amazing, whiskey hits you up front with soft mouthfeel and like velvet slips into dark cherry notes.  Very complex.

Very nice effort from Firestone! ",99.63,jcbrewer,California,11%,Firestone Walker 11 (XI Quercus Alba)
