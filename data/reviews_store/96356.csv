Bitter and very rewarding going in leading to a smooth and dry finish. some sweetness with the bitterness. I found no sourness. Lacing is wonderfull.

I had the beer for free thank god from my bar tender. I quickly asked her to get rid of the glass. She replyed ""mind if I try it?"" To which I said ""Id rather spare you and have you pour it out.""
