Pours like a RIS should, more like syrup than beer. Nice looking head, between latte and mocka, but head retention is short. Smells lovely, a lot of roasted and burnt flavors, coffe, chocolate, bread. Once you have a mouthfull, theres more from where that came from, but also some vanilla and licorice. Sweet early that fades into a bitter finish. After a few mouths, the ABV is more apparent, but not in a bad way. Enjoyed it a lot.
