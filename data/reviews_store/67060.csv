I found a gem in the middle of the Fresno ghetto!  I am really stoked because the head brewmaster Bill takes aging very serious.  This was an 06 on tap!!!!!  For a small brewery this guy knows what is good for a beer.  Time in the fuckin dark!  California brewers watch out.  This RIS is fuckin insane.  No joke probably the 2nd best RIS Ive ever had.  Poured dark with an eight of an inch of brown head.  Nose was toasted marshmellow and coffee.  Taste was incredibly smooth and easy drinking.  As it warmed it got better and better.  Got a ton of coffee and was really really wet on the finish.  Very full bodied and thick.  A little too pricey is the only downfall. ,,TheRealBastard,California,11%,Full Circle Russian Imperial Stout
