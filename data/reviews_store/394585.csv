To me, dry makes me gag. I dont like sickeningly-sweet stuff either, but dry is just horrid.

Which is why, after tasting so many hard ciders, I happen to think this one is so excellent. Its not too sweet, DEFINITELY not dry (except a very slight dryness, which is okay), and it is mellow. And mellow is a key word here, as so many hard ciders tend to be way too tart and crisp. One might as well be drinking champagne when trying most other ciders. I dont want pucker factor or too much crispness in my ciders, and certainly not dryness (much less in wines). Apples are sweet. They are not dry. Cider should not be anything but slightly dry as far as I am concerned.

Bold Rock achieved a great thing with this cider, and I highly recommend it! ",38.626,jerseycaptain,Virginia,4.7%,Bold Rock Virginia Draft
