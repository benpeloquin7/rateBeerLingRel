Nice amber orange colour, minimal head - a bit lifeless and heavy to look at.   Very bitter front of mouth, with a lot of length. Really benefits from some time in the glass to allow the very fruity characteristics to reveal themselves. Carries its high alcohol content pretty well, but as a 2012, would like to try it again some time in the future when I think it will be a better beer - clearly has the alcohol content and structure to keep for a good length of time.  Nice middle of the road palate - happily far more lively then it looks.  ",99.418,puch,California,10.4%,Sierra Nevada Hoptimum
