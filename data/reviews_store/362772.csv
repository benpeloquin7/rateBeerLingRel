Aroma: Sweet and malty

Mouthfeel: Medium body and moderate carbonation

Taste: Fairly sweet, bready, malty hints of caramel. Lingering hoppy bitterness on the back of the tongue after swallowing.

Appearance: Creamy head was short-lived. Fizzy sound -- like pouring a soda in a glass. Little to no lacing. Mild streaming carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. Dark brown cola color that has a nice red tint when held to the light.

Aroma: Nice toasty barley smell. Slight hint of coffee aroma.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation on the tongue.

Taste: Presents with a nice rich malty flavor. Some sweetness reminiscent of prunes or raisins (but not cloying or overpowering, just a hint) Slight hoppy bitterness on the finish.

Overall: A very pleasant, drinkable beer. ",85.909,MicheleStitches,Oregon,7%,Full Sail Bock (Double Bock)
