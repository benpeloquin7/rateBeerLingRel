I enjoyed it on draft at the brew pub in Niagara and later knocked back two cans at home, so its decent but not my favourite. It reminds me of Duggans #9 which is the IPA that got me into IPAs. If they were hoping to expose tourists and non-craft drinkers to better beer, this brew could be considered an IPA with training wheels. Being located at the nexus of tourist trap Niagara Falls, they have a unique opportunity to educate the masses about craft beer and different styles. They played it safe here with a sweeter, easy-drinking brew with this recipe but I cant fault them for it given their location and target market!
