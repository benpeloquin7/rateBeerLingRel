Bottle poured into a pint. Poured a hazy orangy amber, with a small but fluffy head. The smell was hops - resin with a background of citrus. The mouthfeel was thick but less than expected, the spice of the hops immediately began to tingle my mouth. The spicy pine flavor of the hops hit before the grapefruit/blood orange citrus and it stayed that way. It finished thinner than expected, and I was lost for a deScriptor for the spice lingering until I saw ginger described in another review. Thats the finish. A fine big bruising DIPA, though lacking a little in finesse. ",99.947,biker30x,Michigan,10%,Bells Hopslam

Vanilla, rye & citrus rule the nose. Thin in the mouth (sadly like a macro) but the flavors of rye, citrus and sweet malt ride a spicy wave of hops. The finish doesnt linger long. In all, a nice drinkable ale but lacking in some of the flavor profiles that I like. ",95.554,biker30x,Illinois,7%,Two Brothers Cane and Ebel

Waves of pine resin, grapefruit & alcohol rising through the full almond colored head, lacing present throughout. Poured a thick hazy amber. Taste those hops. Pine, citrus and a hint of vanilla from the malt. The alcohol warms (burns?) the palate while the hops sting.  Its thick in your mouth and lingers with a floral/alcohol aftertaste. Surprisingly drinkable. The power of each flavor makes up for the lack (expected in a DIPA) of balance.  Having also had it bottled, the only difference is a slightly increased vibrancy on tap.
