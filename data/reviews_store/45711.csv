Excellent retention and sticky lacing.
S: Big juicy citrus fruit notes with a slap of pine also. Nice undercurrent of caramel malt and slight toasted grain.
T/M: Nice citrus fruit notes blanket the tongue followed by a raging rush of bitterness. Fruit hop notes get a bit drowned out by the excessive bitterness, which lasts on the palate for a good long while, and take on more of grassy characteristic. Toasted grain is present also, but only for a short time as again the hop demand attention. Lip smacking tongue scratchingly bitter. A bit juicy and chewy and just slightly buttery. Medium to thick bodied.
D: A very bitter beer, but still a good one. Definitely worth seeking out if youre a hophead ",86.961,largemammal,Pennsylvania,8.5%,Sly Fox Odyssey
