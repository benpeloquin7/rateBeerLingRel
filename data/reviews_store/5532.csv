The appearance is amber-red, but cloudy from being bottle-conditioned. The head disasapated quickly, but a small layer of bubbles maintained until the last sip.
The flavor is intensely sweet and sour. The sourness mostly comes from the barrel aging, but also seems to be from some lactic fermentation. Vanilla, light wood smoke, fruitiness (more grape-like than strawberry), toastiness, and tobacco hit hard first. Caramel, toffee and lingering tannic bitterness round out the finish. There is plenty of bitterness, but it is only revealed after swallowing.
The palate is a bit harsh in terms of tannic reaction on the tongue and some alcohol warming.  As the dense liquid reaches mouth-temperature, the flavors reveal themselves, as so does a slickness that lasts well into the finish. 
Id say, ""Sip this beer, and appreciate it as if it were a beer from the Fantome Brasserie."" A very nice farmhouse ale.

Color is a deep, dark red. Aroma is reminiscent of opening a Nestle Crunch bar - not too chocolatey, but sweet. Silky, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Soft. Delicate flavor is a mixture of mellow toasted barley, vanilla and dark chocolate that quickly turns dry from the hops. Odd lingering sweetness competes with the hops in the finish. Chocolate is present throughout. Pleasant overall. I'd like to see this beer packaged in a 6-7oz size, more appropriate for the style. Tasting this fresh, I really wonder how well this beer would age?

Didnt appreciate it stand-alone, but it paired quite well with california roll and spicy tuna sushi.  ",10.905,beertvguy,Japan,5%,Sapporo Yebisu
