All I know is Im locked up in a country where it is very difficult to find weed, which is what I actually like, and Amsterdam Navigator gives me a very satisfying consolation. I dont know what they put in it and I couldnt care less about the taste, but it gets me high in a very nice way, reminiscent of cannabis. Cannabis is better, but this is as good as I imagine a beer could  possibly get.  ",1.912,simone1000,Netherlands,8.4%,Amsterdam Navigator
