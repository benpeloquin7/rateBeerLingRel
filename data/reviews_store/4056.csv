(Ill get back to that in the taste section.) Color is a nice golden, medium dark honey. A weakish head, with not much staying power, but proper carbonation seems to be present. Taste is unassuming and rather bland. Some sweetness, very, very little hops, not much complexity, grainy, and despite a somewhat (albeit light) caramel color, no notes come through at all. The finish does show a maltiness, that overstays its welcome.  Not horrible, definitely drinkable on a hot day, but no more than an average amber, actually, slightly below average.
