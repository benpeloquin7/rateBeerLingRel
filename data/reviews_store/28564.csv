Pours with a thick cushion of head, like meringue, that lasts on and on, continuously replenished with streams of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. A beautiful, classy beer.  The aroma is restrained.  Flavor is crisp and bright, easy to drink despite the high alcohol.  Definitely a benchmark beer. ",98.244,bflatjeff,Belgium,8.5%,Duvel

I tasted this first at the Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival, then on tap at San Diego Brewing Co., and finally now in bottles.  Pours a clear orange, like a young cognac, not cloudy in the least.  Decent head formation but dies relatively quickly.  Small bubbles are consistent but dont maintain the head.  A drier triple, especially in terms of finish, almost bitter but not unpleasant.  Spices more prevalent than fruit, and without a distictive yeast taste as the Chimay or Westmalle triples, or Unibroues La Fin du Monde.  I like it, even though it stikes me as a definitely ""West Coast"" interpretation rather than a true emulation of the Belgian style. ",88.383,bflatjeff,California,9.7%,Green Flash Trippel
