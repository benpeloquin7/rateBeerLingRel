The taste is very similar to a fruity vinegarette, but without the acidity. I would say the mouthfeel is a little syrupy, but not so thick. For some reason I get a little bit of a kick in the back of my throat, no idea where that comes from. Hardly any carbonation at all, poured agressively, yet no head whatsoever. This is a great beer, and am happy to drink it to celeberate my buddy Alans birthday. Cheers! ",96.761,Javier25,Netherlands,11.9%,De Molen Bommen & Granaten (Bombs & Grenades)
