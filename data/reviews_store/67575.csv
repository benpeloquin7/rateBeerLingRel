Pretty clear, nice rosy amber color.  Thin head with tiny bubbles.  Very little sediment.

Earthy cavey aroma.  I could make out little else.

Fairly thin, with lots of earthy hop flavors.  Easy drinking with a big lingering hop bitterness.

Pours ever so slightly cloudy, pale orange. Very little carbonation -- only a few bubbles came to the surface. Smells overwhelmingly of mustard with a background of honey. Taste is tart and honey, lacking any maltiness. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. The beer is almost as flat as water. Tart, spicy lingering aftertaste.

Made me downright unhappy. Drain pour. ",42.87,acostein,Netherlands,5%,Jopen Adriaan Witbier
