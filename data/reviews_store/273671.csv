Smells very floral with a bit of bite to the aroma. Odd golden colour, worst colour of the Dansk Mjd selections in my opinion. It has no head, but its wine so it shouldnt be expected. Tastes like honey with floral notes and hops. Thick on the pallette, but not as thick as other selections from Dansk Mjd. Excellent mead. The ~$33 price tag is hefty but for good reason 1) better mead than what your pay $10-$15 and 2) remember it is coming from Denmark. ",87.047,Pathemamike,Denmark,19%,Dansk Mjd Viking Blod
