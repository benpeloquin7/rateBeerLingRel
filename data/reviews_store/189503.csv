Im a new fan of pale ale but an old fan of Peter Carlsson och Bl Grodorna.  Having one of these is a grand treat but it is sadly pretty hard to find, if you get a chance and like this kind of beer than buy yourself a bottle and enjoy it. 

Its a great treat in a bottle ",71.576,Ingels,Netherlands,5%,Kloss Ljus Ale
