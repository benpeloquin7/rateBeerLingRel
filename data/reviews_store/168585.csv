Came in a 16.9 oz. bottle with a label that looks like one of my homebrew labels.  What it lacked in outward appearance, it more than made up for inside.  Beautiful amber color with a billowing/creamy tan head.  Aroma is American hops and sweet caramel malt.  Flavor is very much like the aroma.  Deceptively smooth and easy drinking for a 7.5%+ beer.  As in the pale, very well crafted and balanced slightly towards the hops.  Very glad to find it here in	SW Virginia! ",98.887,summy,Maine,7.2%,Maine Beer Zoe
