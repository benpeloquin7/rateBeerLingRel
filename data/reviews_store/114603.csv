Light brown head is fairly dense and persists well. Aroma is dominated by dark and roasty malts, coffee, chocolate, a tiny amount of charcoal, and a barely perceptible alcoholic note. Flavor is roasty in character with a moderate bitterness; the initial impression of espresso gives way nicely to a long chocolate-toffee finish. Id be hard pressed to find much evidence of hops in either the aroma or the flavor. Overall, smooth and fairly rich, with low astringency. ",90.776,sharrowz,Ohio,5.8%,Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper

Aroma is fairly light; pine and citrus hops balanced by caramel and toasty malt. Flavor is likewise light and balanced between caramel maltiness and a clean cascade bitterness. Medium body. Finishes dry with a little lingering bitterness. Overall, an easy drinking pale ale thats hop-forward, but less than many other examples of the style.
