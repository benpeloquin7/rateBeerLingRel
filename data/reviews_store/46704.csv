Also alcohol.
The body is a rich, bloody brown with a yellowish-white head.
Smooth, yet harsh, spicy.  The everlasting acidic bite reminds me of The Reverend, from Avery.  
Also, this beer tastes wet somehow, and yes, I realize wet is not a taste.
Bitter, sharp finish.
Bottle shared with wheninhell. ",97.262,theReverend,Colorado,8.7%,Great Divide Hibernation Ale

Strong, fruity, fresh and clean nose.
The always charming missive on the bottle for this one talks up the ball-breakery of this beer, but when I drink it I just get smooth, fruity, fizz, yeast...and of course HOPS.  I capitalize this because the brewery would want me to, and if I wanted to be in the good graces of a brewery it would be Stone.  (Free beer?)
Im sitting here drinking this beer with wheninhell, whose review I peeked at for half a second to catch the word ""grapefruit"", which immediately made me curse myself for not thinking of that.  Its very true, so thanks for that.
The aftertaste is like a wheaty, non-sweetened candy, if such a thing exists. ",99.736,theReverend,California,8.2%,Stone Ruination IPA

Amber colored body.

Clean sweet scent.

Taste is sharp, spicy at first.  Smooth, malty finish.

Yeasty, a lot of malt, some alcohol, sweet syrupy middle. 

With warming (as when bottle is left out while drinking) the after taste becomes somewhat sour, though not unpleasantly.

Not the thickest Ive seen, but make no mistake, this is a hearty brew. 

Sharpness makes it better for a tasting or occasion than for everyday drinking.

 Also, I found an interesting hint of apple, like an unusually sharp and complex red delicious.

I had to rate this beer first for an obvious reason, but it also happens to be one of my favorites.  The 1.6 bottle is good to split with a friend while discussing the existence of God(s). ",91.426,theReverend,Colorado,10%,Avery The Reverend
