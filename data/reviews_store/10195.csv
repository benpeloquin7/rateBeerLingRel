The rich redish color hinted of the full body taste to come.  The flavor was strong with hops and caramel and maybe a hint of spice.  The taste held well and since I like beer with a distinctive flavor that is not too bitter, I really enjoyed this one. ",99.206,dhickethier,California,7.2%,Arrogant Bastard Ale
