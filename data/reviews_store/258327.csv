Not quite sure what the rye brings to the table, except extra bitterness and it rhymes with 'I'. Needs better balance. But, saying that the body is good, and it has a lovely nuttiness.

What I assume are Munich malts add some sweetness, balancing out the hoppyness. Less grassy notes than most IPAs, traditional UK style.
