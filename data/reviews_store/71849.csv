The first thing you notice is the nice color and beautiful head that settles at the top. The aroma hit me with a hint of banana followed by a slight bit of clove. The taste was amazing, and with the alc % being nthat high, I was surprised to find so incredibly smooth. This one is a little more complex and I really had to think about all the complexity over the amazing taste. The taste is so smooth, I forgot about the strength. It goes down very nicely and finishes with a crisp palate that left me wanting another one. ",99.524,magildagom,Colorado,10.2%,Avery The Maharaja Imperial India Pale Ale
