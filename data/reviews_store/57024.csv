Why? Even 2007 is a little early. Bottle # 80846. At any rate, this poored an off white head. Dry. Bitter. Sweet. Dark Fruit flavors. People on here do a wonderful job of rating their beers. However, this rating is too low. Perhaps in a couple of years the rating will go up because the Fuller Vintage Ales get better with age. I can say for certain though this will please beer lovers a lot more than the Fullers Vintage Ale from 2000 which has a really high rating (only other Fullers vintage ale Ive had).
