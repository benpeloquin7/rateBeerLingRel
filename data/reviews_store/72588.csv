Weak taste-its a shame this is the best selling American brew.  Oh well ill stick to a few of the better brews.  BTW my son used to drink Bud and Coors Light- funny when I gave him a Saranac or Yuengling he would comment ""Dad you like those beers that taste like beer""  Today, I am proud to say my son also like beers that taste like BEER too.  Well it goes to show that there is some hope for th younger generation. ",0.147,buzzgreg,Missouri,5%,Budweiser

Very good and crisp- a slight sweet taste that I liked.  I liked the old pounder bottles 16 oz- very good if chilled on ice.  I cant understand how these wonderful beers are not sold everywhere?  I guess if you cant make it nationwide... oh well   ",12.458,buzzgreg,Pennsylvania,4.5%,Stegmaier Gold Medal
