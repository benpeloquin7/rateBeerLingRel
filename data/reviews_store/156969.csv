Nearly black, but not fully opaque, pours a fairly modest head, which doesnt last for long.

Aroma:
Belgian style malt, a hint of the roasted caramel malt, perhaps toffee?

Surprisingly light-bodied and hoppy given the aroma. I expected a Belgian-type dark ale, but the hops make this something else. Light at first, but with a strong aftertaste. A rather pleasant mixture of malt and hops in fact!

Overall:
Well, theres no hint of snow here in North Carolina, where Im drinking the beer, but its a rather chilly February night nevertheless, and Ive got a roaring fire going on, so I can relate to the Snow Day theme. This is not a particularly warming beer though, despite the reasonable ABV. I think that they couldve safely pushed the ABV even up to 9% or so without doing any harm to the characteristics of the beer. Sipping it further, the hops start to dominate a bit though, so perhaps the malt couldve been left a bit more room to breathe.

Taste
Well, Im going to go out on a limb here and say that I taste some chocolate Its a rather milky combination of chocolate and malt though, rather than the very dark, roasted chocolate flavour that you get with some Chocolate Stouts (I have Youngs Double Chocolate Stout in mind in particular). The beer supposedly packs a lot of hops as well, but I cant really taste them, the chocolate and malt are overwhelming. Perhaps there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste, but that as well is dominated by notes of roasted malt.

Interesting! Rather strong toffee/caramel, with some fresh fruitiness  presumably due to the wheat and Citra hops  and a hint of hops. Delicious aroma!

Taste
Not as sweet or candy-like as you might expect from the aroma, but the toffee/caramel characteristics are certainly there. Initially the taste is almost disappointing, because it doesnt compare with the aroma, but its the aftertaste that counts here, and the sweet notes linger at the back of the tongue. The wheat and fruity notes are quite masked, but the beer has a certain freshness to it, which is peculiar when combined with the toasty sweetness. Good stuff, but it could use a bit more depth.

A 25th anniversary special edition by this New Orleans based brewery, this beer is supposed to be something different, and I guess it is  but I have not had the original Abita Turbodog that this beer is based on, nor any other Abita beers, so I cant compare (yet!).

Coffee is evident, but its fairly mild. Theres not an awful lot of character or body to this beer. Its satisfying though, and the hint of coffee (less than you might expect from the aroma) does give it a bit of something extra  I suspect that otherwise this might be a rather bland porter.

Overall
Im sampling through the beers of Highland Brewing Company, a brewery which I had not heard before I came to North Carolina. Theyre located in Asheville, and their beers are readily available in Chapel Hill. The branding is a bit silly, with a bearded guy armed with a back pipe and a pint in the label. So, theyre trying to be Scottish, and I guess that their beers are somewhat influenced by Scottish brewing traditions, but theyre no match really.

Ive had the Arrogant Bastard from tap before, and I recall quite liking it. Its hoppier than I remembered, and indeed youd think that this is a particularly bitter IPA from just tasting it. The strange thing is that it looks like a brown ale, and the creamy head would suggest something completely different than what you get: in your face hoppy intensity. Stone Brewing makes a case for this beer being something alternative that not many people will like, but actually I think that this comes quite close to some of the stronger and bolder IPAs or maybe Double Pale Ales that are not uncommon in the US.

Aroma
Alcohol and malt, contrasted by an elaborate mix of hoppy aromas.

Taste
You sip a beer like this expecting quite a kick, and thats what you get: strong alcohol, sharp on the tongue. The malt takes over then, but only for a moment, before the hoppy characteristics appear. That doesnt last long either though, because the aftertaste is a mixture of warming malt liquor and pure alcohol. Fairly tasty, but a bit strong!

Overall
Flying Dog is an interesting brewery with some big beers. This is one of the Canis Major special edition, extra strong beers. The Double Dog is a good beer, but the alcohol is too much for me. I feel like the delicate mixture of hops would have much more to give if you could actually taste it; now the alcohol and strong maltyness are a bit overwhelming. Still, its tricky to pull of beers with this kind of ABV, and this is certainly not one of the worst attempts, its an enjoyable beer that will not leave you cold during the winter months.

I havent been drinking many lambics recently, but it is a type of beer that I quite like.

Porter is perhaps my favourite style of beer, and Im always keen to try new ones. Having tried so many of them, my criteria is quite strict, so although this could easily be rated 4/5 being a rather nice beer, Ive dropped one mark because Ive had so many excellent porters.

Ive never heard of this Danish brewery located on the island of Bornholm, but their website lists a selection of very interesting looking beers  such as a Chocolate Stout and a Red Hot Chili Ale  and if their Jule Spektakel is anything to go by, they might be very good indeed. This beer is certainly Belgian Style in most of its characteristics, but it has added spicyness and some sweetness resembling dried fruit. The combination is tasty, and quite fitting for a Christmas Ale.

Sweet and spicy, warming  what youd expect from a Christmas Ale. Ginger is perhaps the strongest flavour, but its a nice mixture of winter spices. Not overwhelmingly strong, but it is a rather sweet beer, so one to be sipped slowly. Its bottle conditioned.

Overall
Peculiar Christmas in English, although not that peculiar. Quite typical, really, but certainly a tasty one. Very nice and warm spices. My immediate reaction was that Id like some gingerbread with this, although the beer is in fact a bit of a Christmas pudding itself! I would like to get a better impression of the beery characteristis, especially the combination of malts. The spices are a bit overwhelming, and you might even think that youre drinking a cup of strong chai instead of a beer. Ngne  does some very good beers, so there shouldnt be a need to hide behind all these spices. Still, this is what you want on a cold winter night, it really does warm you up nicely. They say that the beer is inspired by glgg, i.e. mulled wine, which is a popular beverage in Finland too around this time of year (we call it glgi). The recommended serving temperature of the beer is 10C/50F, but on their website they hint that you might try it warmer  I take it that this is to suggest actually heating it up, like you would with mulled wine.

Smoky, but not too strongly, a distinct aroma of smoked food rather than anything else. Difficult to discern anything else.

Taste
Fairly mild, the smoke is not particulraly strong, but its certainly there. I was expecting more of the smoke flavour. Then again, the beer doesnt have any other strong characteristics, so even the fairly mild smokyness is enough to overpower other aspects of the beer, such as the rye malt. The Cascade hops is what comes through next, but the malt is somehow in the background.

Overall
Im not overly impressed with this beer. I do like the concept of a Rauchbier  a smoked beer  but I think the Germans may be better at this Obviously, if youre going to do a smoked beer, you better make sure that the other characteristics of the beer are such that they can take the smokyness, or you could go all out with the smoke in which case it doesnt really matter. But this beer is somewhere in between. It tastes more like a pretty generic beer with a little bit of smokyness. There is a rather similar beer by another Finnish brewery, Karhu (a brand owned by Sinebrychoff, which is in fact owned by Carlsberg  so not that Finnish after all!), called Korpisavu. That one is based on generic, crap beer, but theyve gone for a pretty smoky flavour, so in the end it might actually be better than the Laitilan attempt. Laitilan does do some other decent beer though, and its a much smaller brewery, so worth supporting simply because of that. I hope to try their porter some time soon.

Black. Pours a very thick head that develops quickly, pour gently!

Aroma
Dark chocolate, alcohol, burnt coffee, malt.

Taste
Strong malt attack with coffee and chocolate flavours, develops into an aftertaste typical for barley wines; warms you up on the way down. Not your typical Christmas Ale flavours, although they do claim to have added some spices to it. Plenty of sweetness too from the added sugar and syrup. Very thick and soupy!

Overall
Interesting! Mikkeller, which is a very productive and experimental brewery, has gone to Belgium to brew this years Santas Little Helper (not that Ive tried the previous ones) and they have produced a fine Belgian Strong Ale. This one has elements similar to Rochefort 8 or 10, which are among my favourite Strong Belgian Trappists  Mikkellers version is much sweeter though. The sweetness is a bit much after a few sips, but I guess its ok given that its a Christmas Ale. The high ABV helps to balance the sweetness a bit though, and makes this a beer to be enjoyed slowly. Certainly worth looking for. ",98.028,Arborescence,Denmark,10.9%,Mikkeller Santas Little Helper 2011

Appearance
Black, pours a very thick, creamy head.

Aroma
Spices, surprisingly fresh, grapefruit?

Taste
Light and fresh to begin with, but kicks with rich maltyness and a bit of a bitter aftertaste. I cant put my finger on the (secret) extra ingredients, but they are not your typical winter spices, I can tell you that much. Theres no cinnamon or the typical warmth that youd expect from a Christmas Ale, but thats actually a nice change and distinguishes this from many other offerings. Fresh but rich and toasty maltyness, that about sums it up. The aftertaste is that of a porter, but you wouldnt guess it from the aroma and the initial burst of freshness. A strange combination, but Im getting to like it as I sip more.

Overall
This was my first encounter with the Anchor Christmas Ales, but they have been doing them for a while! Every year the (secret) recipe changes and they have a theme tree, which is the bristlecone pine this year. The label is quite pretty, featuring the tree. This beer grew on me as I went on and I would say that its an excellent addition to this years Christmas Ales. Also worth noting is that the ABV is not as insane as with many Christmas Ales, so you can have another one too! Anchor Brewing is a very distinguished brewery, from San Francisco, but Ive not had very many of their beers. The Porter deserves a special mention, its quite tasty. Ive had Anchor Steam as well, but thats it, I think  should get my hands on their other beers too, like their Bock, and Barley Wine, dubbed Old Foghorn.

Slightly hazy, light copper/amber, pours a lovely thick head.

Aroma
Very mild, surprisingly. Typical IPA hops can be detected, maybe a hint of floral aroma, but very little to it.

Taste
Quite mild in terms of the hops (Goldings hops), but they do kick in a little bit in the aftertaste, which is nice and lingering. The really surprising thing about this beer is the maltyness though; this is something that I dont expect from an IPA. I do actually like it, theres a nice balance between the hops and the malt. Then again, when I open a bottle of IPA I expect something a little more on the hoppy side.

Overall
Im used to extremely hoppy IPAs from my visits to North America, so this one seems a little tame. A very drinkable beer though, would try again if there werent any other interesting options. This is also bottle conditioned, so it matures nicely in the bottle (this gives it the slightly cloudy appearance as well). I like many of the beers by Fullers  their London Porter is among my very favourites  but I dont think Ive tried this one before.

Black, thick. Pours a modest head.

Aroma
Toasty coffee, hint of malt and dark chocolate.

Taste
Milder than youd think from the aroma. A rather sharp bitterness from the coffee, not as toasty as I expected though, especially given the roasted malt. Very dry, but mellows out quickly, leaving a lingering coffee flavour.

Overall
Unfortunately the typical stout characteristics are overwhelmed by the coffee, so you might very well get the impression that youre drinking coffee with beer in it. The beer is very smooth though, and if you do like coffee stouts then this is worth a try  after all, this beer did win the speciality beer category in the The World Beer Awards in 2009.

Ive developed a taste for coffee stouts on my visits to North America, where this type of beer has been very popular especially recently. I have to say that almost all of the coffee stouts Ive had in the US and Canada beat the Dark Star offering, but I do like this one as well. I think that the main problem is the relatively low alcohol content and the underdeveloped stout characteristics that cant match the rich coffee flavour. Perhaps the best beer of this type Ive had is the Steamworks Espresso Stout, from Vancouver. ",73.695,Arborescence,England,4.2%,Dark Star Espresso Stout (Keg & Bottle)

Golden, hazy, visible bits of sediment from bottle conditioning.

Aroma
Light, tiny bit of fresh hops.

Taste
Much stronger flavour than youd expect from the aroma. Good combination of malt and hops, although theres something peculiar about the hoppy characteristics in what seems to be a fairly typical Belgian ale with a malty background. Some bitterness in the aftertaste.

Overall
I was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than expected taste, the lingering aftertaste makes this interesting as well. However, its really a pretty standard Belgian ale, and Ive certainly had much better ones. This appears to be a fairly new brewery, only established in 1999  Ive not come across it before. They do a smoked porter which might be interesting, if I could find it somewhere I found this bottle from the Finnish alcohol monopoly, Alko. I dont think that its a part of their standard selection, but they had some sort of an Octoberfest campaign and I belive this beer was a part of that, no theyre already removing it from their selection.

Slight haze due to the beer being unfiltered, smooth. Pours a nice head, but not a very thick one.

Mild, slightly hoppy, floral.

Quite mellow and light. Hops are the predominant flavour, perhaps more so than in your typical trappist. Not very malty, more of floral flavours, and maybe a hint of citrus.

Overall
This organic unfiltered trappist beer by the only trappist brewery outside of Belgium is decent, but a bit light for my taste. I like the concept of making an organic trappist beer like this, but it mightve been better as a double. Probably not worth going out of your way to try this, but it was a pleasant enough beer to drink on its own. I recently had the La Trappe Witte as well, which is also rather light and pleasant.

Taste
Very light at first, you can just about make out the lemon. This is a bottle conditioned beer and that gives it a nice carbonation, I like that in a wheat beer. Lingering sweetness in the aftertaste, mixed with some bitterness from the lemon. I cant pick out the coriander, but it might be partly responsible for the interesting aftertaste.

Overall
Not very impressive at first, but the aftertaste makes this quite pleasant. Otherwise it might in fact be too easy to drink in its lightness. The remaining yeast from the bottle conditioning does give it some more character though, and I could certainly see myself drinking this in the summer, even if I wouldnt go look for it specifically.

Clear, golden, looks quite carbonated. Doesnt produce an impressive head; it disappears quickly.

Aroma
Certainly smells of ginger, but not too strongly, the citrus is also there; fresh.

Taste
A Surprisingly strong ginger flavour, it lingers and finds its way to the back of mouth. The ginger hides most of the citrus, but its there. Sweet aftertaste.

Overall
Not a very beery beer, mostly due to the strong ginger, but also due to complete lack of hops I think. Ive had a few alcoholic ginger beers (I have fond memories of the house beer at the Ginger Man  very drinkable but not as gingery as this one). Its a good beer, not afraid to give you the full tang of ginger. Also manages to be quite flavoursome for such low alcohol content. Williams does some very nice beers, Im always up for trying a new one from them. I acquired this one from Stockmann Herkku in Helsinki, Finland.

The mouthfeel is rich and malty, typical for a barley wine, but the strong alcohol content is well balanced and does not ruin the taste at all. There is a peculiar aftertaste, most likely due to the toffee: sugary sweetness. Its a bit strange in a beer like this, and I can see how it might not be to everyones taste, but its certainly quite original.

A very interesting collaborative beer with one of the most inventive and crazy breweries from Scotland (BrewDog) and a good US brewery (Three Floyds), which Im familiar with but havent had the chance to sample their products very much yet. Im very familiar with BrewDog however, even though they produce such a vast range of beers that its difficult to keep up! Anyway, being a big fan of single malts and especially the peaty and smoky whiskies coming from Islay and around, I was very curious about this beer. After fermentation the beer has been aged in old Jura single malt whisky barrels for 8 months. Ive visited Islay and Jura, which are two adjacent islands. The beer didnt disappoint, although Id like a more intense whisky or peat flavour  in the US Ive had a few beers branded as Scotch Ale which have had a slightly more intense whisky flavour to them, but without the peat. Its worth noting that theres no smokiness in this beer, unlike in many of the Islay whiskies (not so much Jura though). Recommended if you can get your hands on it. I sampled this one at one of my favourite pubs in Helsinki, Kuikka, but it did cost me 14 euros! ",82.799,Arborescence,Scotland,11.5%,BrewDog / Three Floyds Bitch Please
