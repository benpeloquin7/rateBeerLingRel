The pour is a hazy honey/amber with a thin off-white head.  The nose is immediately malty and a bit sweet.  The taste is incredibly balanced with plenty of the sweet maltiness up front but a noticeable (but not overpowering) touch of cascade hopiness on the back.  If taken quite cold it is very crisp and light for a lager.  As it warms, the finish does get a bit stickier and keeps an aftertaste that lingers a bit overlong.

It pour hazy with a thin white head, as one would expect.  The nose was faintly of bread with hints of clove and banana.  So far, so good.  Sadly, the taste does not follow suit.  It was rather weak and watery in taste, even for a wheat beer.  The breadiness is there, as are some of the banana and clove notes; the orange and coriander promised on the bottle are nowhere to be found.  After a few sips, the taste of alcohol comes through, somewhat unpleasantly.  After a few more sips, the aftertaste takes on that of a slightly warmed macro-brew pils.

It isnt a complete failure, and is certainly worth its asking price.  Still, it is not exemplary and will certainly be below-par for anyone, like myself, who has a penchant for wheat beers. ",28.709,idbowman,Ohio,5.5%,Wooden Shoe Stallostown Wheat
