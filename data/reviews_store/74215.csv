Head is ok on the pour, but dissipates fairly quickly.  Sporadic lacing down to the end of the glass.  Color is golden with a very mild cloudiness in the light.  Aroma is citrus and yeast.  Tasted spicy and alcohol made a nice appearance as the beer warmed.  Hops come through secondary to malt and yeast, but work to create a nice overall balance.  Overall, I really enjoyed this one.
