Aroma of crystal and chocolate malts, big load of fruity late hops. 
Taste as aroma would suggest, big malty sweetness up front balanced with good bitterness and lots of hop flavour. Full malty mouth feel cleaned by late bitterness leaving you begging for more. Fantastic beer! ",93.395,Thebeeriest,Australia,6.4%,Murrays Angry Man Brown Ale
