Cant really say much about it. Had a huge white foamy head that stayed for awhile. Pretty color, smell- weak. Not worth 6.99 by any means however, its much better than Budweiser... Though that isnt hard to accomplish.  Made a 10 out of 20 and Im giving the benefit of the doubt that they tried. ",2.793,underthelegal,Missouri,5%,Michelob

I notice a lot of people bashing this beer but, if you notice the higher rated beers on this and other sites they are all stouts. Do not try to compare this lighter beer to a stronger stout. Thats like trying to compare Jimmi Hendrix with Snoop Dogg. This beer has a really bitter/skunky taste to it- which I prefer. Some people find it revolting but, these people tend to drink Miller or Bud Light. But, out of all the beers I have yet to taste this is my favorite. Way better then Hieneken and a Million times better than Stella Artois which, in my opinion isnt worth the price. However, Stella is marketed as a Malt Liquor? All in all this is a good drinking beer. ",8.617,underthelegal,Germany,4.8%,Becks
