Dark color, medium body.  Khaki head quickly dissapates to a film, but leaves a nice lacing. Suprisingly light silky palate, and very smooth.  Definitely chocolate, toffee, caramel, and maybe even a little dark cherry.  Nothing spectacular, but a good drinking beer to come back to. ",55.136,gallaghermurph,Louisiana,5.6%,Abita Turbodog

Very light on the palate with an initial wheat and light yeasty flavor - lets you know that this is, indeed, a beer - followed  by distinct, yet mildly watery fruit flavors.  Predominantly currant, but also a bitter apple, cherry, and peach.  Finishes with an quick, mild bitterness. Drinks like a sparkling cider.

Decent lacing.  Initial flavor is nuts and coffee lending to an overall roasted flavor.  The remaining flavors I found to be present at first, but became became more prevelant as the beer warmed:  Hints of chocolate turns over to caramel then understated hoppy citrus brings sweetness. Also a distinct underlying bitterness throughout .  Drinks smooth yet crisp and not too heavy.  Found the soba to be undetectable, but Im not sure I knew what to look for .  A good drinkable beer overall, but nothing terribly special. ",68.467,gallaghermurph,Oregon,5.3%,Rogue Morimoto Black Obi Soba Ale
