There is considerable, but very fine and soft, carbonation that pierces the otherwise dense palate. The taste starts with bland notes of nut, wood, and malt, but soon develops notes of date, fig, plum, and a sprinkling of brown sugar. The remainder of the beer is characterized by a substantial crescendo in alcohol and spice intensity, resulting in a climax of clarity (as if peeling away the palate thickness and disintegrating the spice flavor) and balanced flavor in the finish, which is notably a bit a heavy. The balance here is between malt, fruit, and yeast with a slight bitter touch. Makes me think of piercing the veil of the maya (c.f.

Pours a dark caramel-amber brown with a foamy tan head and tree branch lacing. Smells of spice (clove), brown sugar, yeast, and alcohol. Full bodied with a boozy feeling into the finish. Tastes of dark caramel, clove, toffee, and yeast with a hint at banana and some dark fruits. Feels heavy and syrupy. Finish is a thick brown sugar and caramel with a kick of bitterness. Pretty well-balanced throughout (there are perhaps a few times when the spice overshadows the other flavors, but nothing too serious). Definitely a good beer, but it doesnt have the light and lithe feeling that some (relatively heavy) Belgian beers have. ",87.218,Shakesbeere,Belgium,6.5%,Leffe Brune

Pours a deep amber caramel brown -- very nice. Smells of buttery and roasted nut, tea, and yeast (the yeast smell was a little unexpected). Taste is initially a malty complex with a striking note of coffee and roast. The dark note is later absorbed into the main body of flavor while releasing notes of butter, nut, citrus, and hops. At the least, an interesting show of flavors. Finish is dry and a tad peppery. An enjoyable pub drink -- not the epitome of beer, but it is at least interesting.
