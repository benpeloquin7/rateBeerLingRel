this beer pours nearly black with a reddish outline when held up to the light. There was nice tan head that left a substansial amount of lacing. The dominant aroma is roasted malt, but there are hints of a bready smell and maybe a bit of toffee...the taste is very subdued at first but it gets more interesting as it warms. medium bodied, easy to drink... a good session beer, very well balanced.

Lots of roasted and chocolate malts. Coffee and caramel flavors compliment the big malty flavors very well. Very smooth and creamy, which gives a nice contrast to the roasted malts and coffee flavors. A little sweeter than some Schwarzbiers that I have had before, but not overpoweringly sweet, this beer has a nice balance of flavors, with no one of them being huge or overdone. The hop presence is noticable but not one of the key flavors in the beer; just a slight floral presence resting in the background.

The beer is completely black with no highlights, even when held up to the light. There is a big, creamy,light brown colored head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of sticky lacing.

Lots of dark/semi-sweet chocolate (I really expected more creamy milk chocolate aromas), roasted malts, and coffee. There are also some smaller hints of dark fruit, toffee, caramel, and molasses that round out the nose. Very nice, appealing aroma that draws you in, and makes your mouth water.

The dominant flavors are that of roasted malts, molasses, some coffee, and to a lesser degree dark chocolate. I expected a huge chocolate bomb, but the use of chocolate seems to be an accent, rather than the focus of the beer. A slight smoky/charred flavor adds a bit of bitterness that balances well with the sweet flavors. Just a hint of alcohol burn that becomes more noticable as the beer warms, but still never tips you off the the big 9.75% ABV. A very well crafted beer. Full bodied and mildly carbonated, dangerously easy to drink and very smooth.

Beers with this much hype surrounding them can oftentimes disappoint. This one does not, I am not sure that it is the best RIS that I have ever consumed, but it definately deserves the fanfare.

This beer is completely black with no highlights and about one inch of dark tan head that quickly recedes leaving behind a fair amount of lacing.

The aroma is all sweet milk chocolate with subtle hints of vanilla, bourbon and honey. Quite a sweet nose with very little roastiness to balance it out.

The taste is very similar to the aroma. Lots of sweet chocolate and honey. Very little in the way of roastiness; there is some there, but not much. There are some hints of bourbon, and some vanilla from the barrel. I get just the slightest bit of alcohol burn. Full bodied and very creamy, the carbonation is spot on. Extremely easy to drink. 

Really this is a terrific beer that will only get better as it ages. Mellow and quite drinkable for an 8.5% ABV Impy Stout. Just a little sweeter than I would typically like, but overall a great beer.

Pours a clear, deep brown color with ruby highlights. Very little head that recedes very quickly leaving behind spotty lacing

The nose is very dark and rich; comprised mostly of caramel, sweet dark fruit, and chocolate. Very, very sweet. There is a slightly smokey aroma that tries to poke through, but the overlwhelmingly sweet aromas seem to choke it out, beating it into submission. 

The flavor is very much like the nose; Sweet. Big cloyingly sweet flavors clash with each other. There is some caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee and just a hint of smoke. This beer has the potential to be complex and flavorful, but the overwhelming sweetness seems to steal the show. Medium/full bodied and mildly carbonated. Almost a syrupy mouthfeel.

Pours an amber/orange color with a moderate amount of off white head that recedes fairly quickly leaving spotty lacing and a crown on the beer that remains until the beer is gone.

The aroma is loaded with piney and citrusy hops. The malt backbone is mainly caramel and fairly sweet, with just a hint of alcohol. Really a straight forward big aroma that is very inviting.

The taste is very much like the smell; huge piney hop presence, with some citrusy hop undertones. The sweet caramel malty presence doesnt quite balance out the hops, but it does compliment them very well. There is just the slightest alcohol burn that only becomes noticable as the beer warms. I would never have guessed that this was a 10% beer based on taste alone. Medium bodied and mildly carbonated, finishes slightly dry. Very drinkable

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Smuttynose Big Beer Balloon Glass. 

The beer pours a slightly hazy light copper color with a small white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of sticky lacing.

The nose is full of citrus and tropical fruits. I get lots of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple; and to a lesser degree lemon, mango, and floral hops. The bready and sweet malts are also quite noticable. The aroma is quite nice with the exception of a slight off aroma that I cant quite put my finger on; almost like a rubbing alcohol (or as some have said, a cleaning product), but this is just a faint hint that is barely noticable.

The flavor is that of citrusy and fruity hops. As in the nose, I get lots of orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, some mango, some pineapple, and some very faint floral hop notes. The malt character is bready and sweet, and just big enough to help balance out this beer without overpowering the hops. Surprisingly, even with all of the sweet malts and fruity hop flavors, there is a bitterness in the finish. Not overly bitter, but definately more than I expected given the smell and sweetness at the beginning of the beer. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Fairly easy to drink, and the 7.7% ABV is well masked.

Not your typical flavor profile for an American IPA, but pleasant none the less.
