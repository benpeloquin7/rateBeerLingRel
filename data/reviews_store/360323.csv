Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden caramel with a foamy frothy head that dissipates quickly.

 Taste: Mildly sweet with a bitter tone that stays (quite refreshingly pleasant); yet simple in its compsition... Nothing outstanding, but well rounded.

Palate: Medium bodied and thin-textured with fizzy carbonation (just right). There is a primarily bitter finish, though it is rather light and short lived.

Overall: The beer is very drinkable and well-rounded. I always drink a beer cool and then well chilled to assess... This one holds well, not needing to be too cold to enjoy. It is a refreshing beer, and not too sweet. You can have a few with no regrets.

Id have to say it is above average, but nothing to rave about. Id recommend it over any big macro-brew.

Aroma: 
 Sweet (brown sugar and chocolate), Coffee-like with a sharp alcohol scent (too strong). A little flowery (hops), but not too much. 

Appearance: 
 Rich, deep dark brown, almost black in natural light. Bubbly, like a cola;topped with a medium foamy head, that quickly dissipates to a thin cream-coloured layer.

Taste: 
 Sweet, heavy candy-like caramel flavour with a strong coffee finish... The alcohol is too pronounced and the sweetness lingers on the tongue. Not too bitter, but a little too salty

Palate:
 Medium bodied creamy feel with mild carbonation (average)... This has a very lingering finish; that is overall sweet and salty... Mildly bitter.


I am pretty liberal with beers (variety is the spice of life); however, this one was lacking. Overall the beer is quite drinkable for such a high alcohol content. I tend to gravitate toward dark beers and higher alcohol contents; but I prefer the ones that have you double-take the percentage feeling there is no way this beer is as strong as it claims (only to go two more in and see the light). 

Here, the beer tastes like is boasting a 7.9 Alc by volume, and makes little attempt to hide it or reward the endurance. 
Although the beers sweetness makes the venture bearable, this battle between sugar and alcohol is too evident and makes for a confusing and generally uncomfortable scrimmage on the tongue.

I had another one chilled really well, and it was an easier drink for sure. I cannot say this beer is a fail; but its just a simple pass. Its drinkable. However I feel the job here is to boast a strong beer you can at least swallow...

Id take rather have few shots and sip a weaker, more worthy brew.
