This stout I could drink for days...unlike the Old Rasputin, which is my favorite.  Its a quality stout with balance and I like to use it as an introductory stout to folks that dont get on well with Guiness. ",90.481,ewest9,California,5.6%,North Coast Old No. 38 Stout

I love the style, and I think North Coast did a really good job balancing the flavor components in this big beer.  When I first discovered it, I wondered why they only sold it in 4 packs!  Needles to say I quickly found out later that evening as the 9% quickly knocked me on my butt.  Love the malt and chocolate with subtle bitters to cut.  Coffee flavors are present, but not too prevalent fortunately, as I am not a coffee drinker.  I love this beer!  But approach it with a healthy fear and reverence.
