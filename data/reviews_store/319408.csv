Sweet and bitter with a zesty character. 
Light amber with a slight haze (thanks non-filtration). Ample head which stays for ages slightly masking the nose.
Sweet and sharp with a bitter finish, not unlike a pink grapefruit - pith included.
This beer balances very nicely on the palate with medium weight, and smooth, slightly creamy texture. Persistent bubbles make for a lively mouthful. The finish is swamped in citrus and sweet malt, with a bitterness which lingers, reminding me again of the grapefruit pith.
Overall this is an awesome beer. 16 oz cans make this an even better experience. Don;t be put off by the fishy packaging.

A whiff of sweet maltiness hits you a moment after you adjust to the sharpness.
Dark orange in color with a shade or two of brown creeping in. Head is white and fell apart quickly but left some lacing on the side of the glass.
Bitter and sweet are both big components, but also balance each other very well. The bitterness wins out with its length.
The body is bold and fairly full leading to a slightly thicker than expected texture. Very lively bubbles keep pushing flavor into the mouth, Sweet and bitter finish, but the orangey maltiness fades before the sharp bitterness does.
I like this beer a lot because it is well balanced, even though the balance is further down to the bitter end of the scale, the maltiness is bold enough to stand up to it.

Medium bitterness hit the tongue first with the sweetness which was promised on the nose just sneaks in.
The mouth-feel is light and crisp with plenty of bubbles. The finish is quick and slightly flat, contrasting the delights that the aroma suggested.
Overall this beer disappointed. Having enjoyed other offerings from Stone this one fell short of the mark. To be fair, it is brewed to be a sessionable IPA so removing the alcohol has taken away somewhat from the body. Compared to other session IPAs its a winner.

The body is bold without being big. Texture is creamy with a touch of stickiness, but the beer flows well. A lively bubble lasted to the bottom of the glass. The finish is in 2 stages, the boldness and sweetness tail off quickly making you think its done, but a bitter encore makes a pleasant surprise.
