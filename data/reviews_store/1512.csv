Practically no hops, and no aftertaste.  I remember thinking the taste to be rather transparent; excellent aroma, but none of that aroma transfers into the flavor of the beer.  Its rather light and easy drinking, but the pumpking flavor doesnt come through as well as does say the Wild Onion Pumpkin Ale (still my fave pumpkin ale).

Although after reading, I thought about their points a bit more.  I do agree, the vanilla/chocolate tones may be overpowering a bit, but I actually like that.  Its a little sweet, very robust in flavor, and smooth drinking.  It is maybe a little watery in comparison to other similar porters/stouts like the Aspen Meadow Vanilla Cream Stout (very thick, but not as tasteful imo), but the taste of this beer more than makes up for that.  Its definitely one of the beers I look forward to drinking when the weather turns colder. ",77.589,chupe66699,Michigan,5.5%,Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter
