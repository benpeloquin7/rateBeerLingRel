They make very very solid beers that taste very traditional to the specific styles that they brew. As far as this beer specifically, I loved their approch. They made a very nice ""session"" style IPA. Good hop presense but not over the top, gives a hophead a good show and is still able to be approchable to a newbie. The galaxy hops add a nice grapefruit/passionfruit citric flavor that is really nice. and for the price i cant think of another IPA that you can get for $7 a 6pk that i would rather have.
