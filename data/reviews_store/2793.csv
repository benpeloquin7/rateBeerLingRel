I realized at that point that there was no need to venture further through the abyss of bland, media exploited beers (i.e.: Molson Canadian, Coors Light, and yes even Labatt Blue just to name a few).
Even though I have been ridiculed for drinking this fine ale, being called the likes of an old man and other unmentionables. I am only 23, but I have come to know that this was a compliment. For if I were an old man I would have the knowledge and experience that comes with age. I do know that Labatt 50 is a true tasting and satisfying beer, whatever the occasion.
