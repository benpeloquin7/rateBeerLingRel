Golden, hazy color with an medium/high carbonation. Yeasty aroma with a distinct sour/sweet ginger note. Stonefruits and oranger combined with zingy ginger. Smooth moutfeel, but a bit weak. Could benefit with a bit higher ABV and greater mouthfeel. Really a good belgian-style beer! ",,kevinjh,Norway,7.5%,Little Brother Buddha From The North

Imperial stout all right! All black with an beige thick head. Aroms is most of all roasted with notes of chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, ginger and pepper together with an undisputed fruity aroma. Ethiopian natural coffee is used and is probably the reason for the fruits and coffee notes. Flavor is roasted with a distinct bitterness and sweet chocolat and friuits. Strawberries dipped in chocolat with crushed gingerbread coockies. Dont know how this will develope with aging since i drank it 2 weeks after botteling.
