I understand Boulevard is now offering this in a bottle conditioned version. I'll have to try it out.

The mouthfell of this one is great, and the head retains nicely, administering a lace with staying power.

This one definately illustrates that body and color are sometimes unrelated. ",53.82,Coppermonk,Missouri,4.9%,Boulevard Dry Stout

Filled with flavor, this would be a nice offering year-round. Seems to age well in the fridge, I'll buy a little more next year. ",78.819,Coppermonk,Missouri,5.8%,Boulevard Bobs 47 Oktoberfest
