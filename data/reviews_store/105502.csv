Off-white head dissipates very quickly. Very inviting deep orange in color. Aroma seems very mellow (lacking?). Bitterness seems fairly moderate. Orange peel seems to be quite subtle. Just enough of a malt backbone makes for a well balanced brew. Medium mouthfeel. Doesnt knock my sock off but a very solid offering. The drinkability is what gets me here. This beer is super refreshing on a hot summer evening and Ill probably be coming back to it again and again. ,95.905,Surly87,Wisconsin,6.5%,Tyranena Scurvy IPA

Wheat sweetness with a fair share of banana, a bit of clove and maybe a little pear. Earthy yeast character and loads of banana on the tastebuds. The mouthfeel of this beer is absolutely perfect.
