It is still a fresh, crisp, lightly maltly and hoppy ale but overall its fame suffers from the original brewery (Weinhardts, Portland, OR) no longer making it.  It tastes like a real good, large brewery, retail beer should taste.  Because it comes from my end of the world (N.W. USA) I have a fondness for it.  Nothing goes down better than a ice cold HW Blue Boar Ale on a hot summer day.  Who gives a hoot what color the bottle is...  keep it cold and drink it empty!
