Artificial berry aromas all the way;  I cannot even discern any semblance of malt. It smells like raspberry-flavored lip gloss or something else waxy. It tastes medicinal and perfumy. I envision a raspberry snow cone that is falsely blue colored.  Ouch. I cant go on; I cant find anything constructive to say. Drainsville.

Pours a glowing golden peach color with a rocky eggshell white head. Pretty solid witbier aromas; coriander, seville orange rind, wheat husk and some other muted spicings. Trace mineral aroma. Very nice. Malty and crisp with a faint acidity intertwined with the malt. Fruity esters are moderate, mostly sweet citrus. Very true to its style and easily enjoyable.
