it does have a good light malty taste.
However, like others have stated, 
the hops taste too grassy. ",16.189,0rbitz9,Pennsylvania,4%,Erie Brewing Presque Isle Pilsner

bland American lager, packaged and 
priced to look like a microbrew. Theres
a slight amount of malty sweetness, 
but some cerial taste as well. The 
body is light with barely any hops. 
Drinkable but not really enjoyable. This 
beer must have been concieved by 
marketing geeks, not serious beer 
drinkers. ",17.134,0rbitz9,New Jersey,4.1%,New Jersey Lager
