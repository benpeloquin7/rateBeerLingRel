A rich amber toffee colour with a small head that very quickly dissipates leaving some lacing. On the nose it has tropical fruit aromas and some piney resin hops, a very pleasant smelling apa. Taste is not as bitter as expected with nice malt and pleasant mouthfeel. Overall very sessionable and refreshing.  ",75.856,RobboLovesBeer,California,5.3%,Karl Strauss Pintail Pale Ale

Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip. Amber in colour with high carbonation and a huge head. Marmalade is there all right with a bit of creamed Manuka honey on the nose. Has massive lacing. Taste, well it all goes downhill unfortunately, it is very sweet with a bit of bitterness that doesn&apos;t meld well. The bitterness stays on the palate but it&apos;s not a good feel. Very disappointing and won&apos;t be visited again. ",,RobboLovesBeer,New Zealand,7.4%,Harringtons Brewers Selection India Pale Ale

A beautiful golden colour with a good inch of solid head. Little lacing. First attempt at this style and impressed with a very interesting nose. Some citrus and sweetness as well as freshly baked brioche and cedar. Bitter with a heavy yeast flavour which dominates the hops, leaves a good mouthfeel and seems to be somewhat true to style from what I gather. Not sure it&apos;s my thing, but not discouraged by the experience. ",97.262,RobboLovesBeer,New Zealand,7%,8 Wired Saison Sauvin
