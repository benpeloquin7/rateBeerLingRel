Appearance (2/5): Pours a perfectly clear, sparkling yellow tint; like ginger ale. Very pale. Absolutely no head.

Aroma (4/10): Sharp apple with lemon, wine, and a musty note.

Taste (4/10): Sharp acidity to begin with, then that chemical-dryness that is so common in cheaper dry cider. A little bitterness in the finish.

Palate (3/5): Light body, lively carbonation, dry texture, and a slightly sticky, dry finish.

Overall (9/20): Not terrible. If you dont like dry cider you wont like this. Quite harsh and unrefined. But it still tastes fresh like all Growers cider, and as a result ends up pretty average. There are better choices.

Appearance (3/5): Pours a cloudy, medium honey-amber hue, with a white, frothy, two finger head that mostly lasts and leaves decent lacing.

Aroma (7/10): Very strong lemon, banana, and pear, with some floral, spice, bubble gum, and caramel notes.

Taste (6/10): Quite fruity sweet, almost too sweet, with a tart touch and a short, soft finish. There is a delicate spicy/yeasty note that reminds me very strongly of Dieu du Ciel. Very light and refreshing, but not incredibly interesting

Palate (3/5): Light body, soft carbonation, watery and slightly oily texture, with a soft, clean finish. Too watery.

Overall (12/20): A very tasty, weizen that could be a little less sweet. I really couldnt drink more then one. Drinkable and refreshing, this is a great beer for hot weather, although there are better choices

Appearance (3/5): Pours a perfectly clear, pale honey-amber, with a minimal, fizzy, diminishing head.

Aroma (5/10): Quite yeasty, with rich apples, citrus, and grass, with subtle notes of spice and alcohol.

Taste (6/10): Muted sweetness, and little tart at the beginning. Crisp apples with spice. I get some champagne like yeast flavors in the finish.

Palate (2/5): Light body, lively carbonation, slightly dry/sticky texture, and a lingering finish. Has a weak body, but ok for a cider.

Overall (11/20): Quite sophisticated for a local cider. The champagne yeast makes it rather unique, and it isnt too sweet or too tart. Not my favorite, because it feels a little heavy and lingering rather then being light and refreshing, but that is simply my personal taste. Very good.

Appearance (2/5): Pours a perfectly clear, sparkling, extremely pale amber (like a pale white wine), with absolutely no head.

Aroma (4/10): Dominant green apple, tainted by a mild chemical note, with lemon and a little wine. Very simple.

Taste (5/10): A very sweet cider. Sweet, fresh apple juice (spoiled with that ugly chemical note) and a winey aftertaste when the alcohol kicks in (which by all means is still modest). Short and clean finish.

Palate (2/5): Very light body, lively carbonation, watery and slightly syrupy texture (like fruit juice) with a slightly sticky finish. 

Overall (12/20): Not really a cider, more of a showcase for the fruit itself. Not much character, and that chemical/medicine note in the apples is disappointing, but very refreshing when served chilled on a hot day. Despite its boring and unrefined character, I could honestly drink it all day.

Appearance (4/5): Pours a slightly hazy (but surprisingly clear for a Trappist ale) light golden yellow with a frothy, white, one finger, lasting head with decent lacing. A little sediment.

Aroma (8/10): Dominant yeasty cheese and barnyard notes, clove, cinnamon, and cardamom spiciness, and lemony citrus, with toffee, perfume, and spruce notes.

Taste (8/10): Very spicy and smoothly bitter with yeasty undertones. Still has the sweet opening youd expect from an abbey ale, but quite muted. Has a salty/savory finish. Alcohol is definitely present on the tongue.

Palate (4/5): Medium/full body, lively carbonation, oily texture that has a slick, dry finish. Warming and satisfying. Very smooth. The saltiness adds a bit of substance.

Overall (17/20): Pretty good. Not exactly my favorite Trappist beer, but it does well and has a unique savory note that isnt at all unpleasant. Reminds me a little of Dieu du Ciels Blanche Neige for some reason. Good for cold weather.

Appearance (3/5): Pours a murky, medium orange-hued brown color. Small, fizzy, light brown, quickly diminishing head with fair lacing.

Aroma (6/10): Dominant yeast aromas: brettanomyces, barnyard, sour milk, earth, with berries, grass, spicy notes and a little caramel.

Taste (7/10): Well for someone who has never tried a wild ale before, the first sip was a bit of a surprise. I guess this is what raters mean by ""funk!""

Appearance (3/5): Pours a murky brownish orange color, with a small, frothy, white head that fully diminishes and leaves little lacing. Lots of sediment.

Aroma (6/10): Dominant fresh ginger, licorice, malt, and raisin, with caramel, spiciness, and alcohol.

Taste (6/10): An extremely short and gingersnap/raisin sweet beginning, that almost immediately turns into a very short, slightly bitter finish.

Palate (4/5): Medium body, lively carbonation, extremely dry and slightly oily texture, with a short and vanishing finish. 

Overall (12/20): (Note: My bottle was labelled ""Real Ginger Brew"", had a green label, and claimed 8.0% ABV.) A pretty good ginger beer. Ginger is actually rather subtle compared to other beers of the type i have tasted. Palate is unique and surprising, but the flavor is disappointing.

Appearance (3/5): Pours a hazy pale yellow, with a two finger, frothy white head that mostly diminishes and leaves good lacing.

Aroma (7/10): Dominant grapefruit, lemon, and floral/grassy hops. Subtler notes of roasty malt, lactic acid, and cheese.

Taste (7/10): Begins with lightly sweet and acidic citrus and lactic acid, with a moderate length bitter finish. The cheese notably comes out in the end. Dominant bitterness overall, but nothing crazy.

Palate (3/10): Medium/light body, vigorous carbonation, very dry texture and finish. Smooth mouthfeel.
