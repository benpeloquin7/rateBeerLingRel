Spring Blonde is NOT one of them! I wish I could have my money back, I dumped 5 of the 6 bottles down the drain...it was not drinkable! I am no beer snob but even I cant drink something this foul! Gross, gross, gross! I truly think puke would taste better! Do not buy this! You are better off with the simple Fat Tire! I am still a New Belgium fan, just not a fan of this particular beer, my taste buds are still trying to get rid of that AWFUL first sip! ",41.918,jackajohn,Colorado,6%,New Belgium Spring Blonde
