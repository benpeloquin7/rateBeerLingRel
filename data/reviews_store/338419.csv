Brown-reddish color. Tan medium head. Citrus aroma, grapefruit. Taste is hoppy, citrus, and not too much alcohol. You cannot tell its 9%. A bit sweet. Nice after taste of bitter and grapefruit... Even though this is not IPA there is a bit of the IPA-citrus-hoppy taste I love.. This is one I would buy again. ",96.308,Smithy_74,Scotland,9%,BrewDog #MashTag 2014
