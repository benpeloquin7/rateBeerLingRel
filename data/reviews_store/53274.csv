Adding the last inch of the bottle instantly alters the appearance to a murky deep amber with a lot of uniform particles/yeast at the base of the tulip.

Light to medium bodied with fine effervescent carbonation that leads to a drying mineral finish with a touch of spicy cardboard. The palate more-or-less follows the nose with some additional tart fruitiness improving the blend. The high carbonation and mineral qualities are a bit off-putting for me, but I generally dislike those qualities in all but a few styles. I think I may have kept this bottle in my cellar/fridge longer than its 7% might warrant, but this is an interesting ""imperial wit"".

The nose is a blend of dry Brettiness and light, fruity yeast notes (pear and apple). Also present is a distinct vinyl note that is a surprisingly pleasant addition to the medley. Once the head dissipates, however, the vinyl note nearly disappears and the aroma becomes more integrated with a touch of spice added to the mix. The palate is light to medium-bodied with soft, fine carbonation and a drying, somewhat tart and moderately funky/sour (good funk) finish. The flavor is less fruity than the nose, with the Brett dominating the flavor profile: horse blanket funk and a mild white pepper note take front stage over a pale malt back that just hints at the apple and pear notes found in the aroma. Quite drying and funky with additional phantom notes of leather and peach pit dancing in and out of focus. This is the kind of beer that could simultaneously scare craft beer newbies away from ""Belgian-Style"" Pale Ales and make Brett fans hear ""Ode to Joy"" in their heads. I lie somewhere between those two groups. I enjoy the nuances that it possesses but I would have preferred it have dialed-in closer to where the nose is at this point. This is definitely an interesting beer, and if Brett is your thing, this is a good candidate to cellar and crack one every 3-6 months to see how it evolves.

The hops and their bright bitterness just ""sing"" in this beer. After years of watching dozens of bottles linger on store shelves, Im very glad to have found a fresh bottle to sample this year. If youre a hop-head and dont need ""balance"", snag a bottle of this while its still fresh. ",97.041,Gregis,Colorado,6.1%,Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale

Pours a deep, opaque brown with a thin cocoa head that drops quickly to an island of bubbles at the surface and spotty lace on the glass. The nose is big and malty with a sweet spiciness, vanilla, creme brulee with some cinnamon, and a sweet woodiness unlike cherry, oak or any other wood addition Ive encountered. Medium-bodied and oily slick with a sweet finish transitioning to a woody, and just slightly hoppy bitter finish/aftertaste. The flavor is quite sweet, possessing many of the same sweet and spicy complexities found on the nose with the addition of a pronounced ashiness and a significantly drying woody finish. This is some really interesting stuff. The wood helps to counterbalance the significant sweetness, but overall, I found the otherwise pleasant wood note to be a bit overbearing after the swallow. Among the DFH ""experiments"" that Ive tried this one fall into the success category. Unlike any other beer that Ive tried it also possesses the admirable quality of being pretty tasty. Thanks again, Dak. :) ",99.259,Gregis,Delaware,12%,Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron

The nose is sherry-like with sweet dark fruit notes dominating a vinous aroma. Medium-bodied and slick with a vinous almost tannic quality at the sweet, slightly boozy conclusion. Sweet and somewhat tart, like a Granny Smith apple, a supporting raisin note leads into a drying finish that whispers a remembrance of the hop bill originally present in the recipe (8 years ago). With the exception of the finish, this more closely resembles a brandy than any other beer that Ive ever sampled. To be more accurate, its more of a hybrid between a barley wine and an apple brandy. This is some interesting stuff. Thanks for recommending it, Aaron. ",75.026,Gregis,England,9%,Gales Prize Old Ale (1920s - 2006)

Pours an attractive burnt orange with a loose, frothy off-white head. The nose is a blend of pumpkin pie spices over a brown/amber malty nose. Fairly typical for the style, the aroma, however, is pretty well-integrated and a solid ""notch"" above-par. Light to medium-bodied and soft with a drying and slightly astringent finish. The flavor profile is an odd if not interesting one: the pumpkin spice dominates a brown ale profile that hides behind with a mineral water quality thrown into the mix. While on-the-tongue it seems fairly spice forward and almost heavy-handed, but after the swallow, the lingering flavor mellows and is actually pretty pleasant. If the entire flavor profile could replicate the aftertaste, this would be a top-tier example of the style. As it is, however, its simply ""better than average"". With both Schlaflys and Southern Tiers pumpkin offerings locally available, I dont think its too likely that Ill be returning to this one any time soon, but I certainly appreciated the opportunity to sample it.

The nose is a nice blend of nutty malt with some cocoa and caramel in the mix along with some spicy and faintly piny hop notes. Medium-bodied and slightly ""grainy"" with a mild to moderately hoppy and gypsum-like drying finish. I found the flavor to be a sizable drop-off from the promising nose. The nutty malt quality is there (sans the cocoa and caramel) with an herbal, grassy and spicy hop presence that dominate the flavor profile. Simply put, the flavor isnt as well integrated as the aroma. It is drying, mineral-like and just too herbal, for my tastes. It seems like they tried to add so much to this recipe that it struggles to find any continuity. Its an interesting hybrid. Its just not one that I would likely purchase again.
