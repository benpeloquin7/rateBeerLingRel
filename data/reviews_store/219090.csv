If the eldritch lord Cthulhu had a beer, this would be it. Im pretty sure the lights in the room dimmed as I poured it. My favorite aspect of this beer is that, despite being as dark as the infinite abyss, it isnt bitter or difficult to drink. Its syrupy no doubt, but that works for it more than in most of the beers that share that trait. Fair warning: Drinking more than one a night might be risking your immortal soul.
