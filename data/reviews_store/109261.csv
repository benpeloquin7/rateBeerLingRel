aroma isnt that strong but there are chocolates, cherries, plums, slight caramel - lots of those malty smells coming through. a very slight freshness from the hops though too. some oakiness in there as well. so a bit complex, but they could all stand to do with a bit of an increase. 
relatively smooth to drink with a light to moderate bitterness and a light sweetness. 
palate is comfortable. slight carbonation, smooth texture and medium body. with an ok finish thats a bit bitter.
all round a pretty solid beer. 
because its marketed as a winter beer though, i guess i was expecting more from the body of the bitterness or the malts or even a bit more sense of the alcohol.  ",49.63,daccas04,New Zealand,6%,Monteiths Doppelbock Winter Ale
