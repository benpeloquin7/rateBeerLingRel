I love bitter IPAs but this one doesnt do it for me. Really, really bitter finish with a clinging metallic aftertaste on the soft palate. Did I suck on a the bar railing on front of me?

What a delicious surprise. Despite it mildly boozy smell and deScription, this beer has a surprisingly soft, fluffy mouthfeel with a semi sweet deliciousness as if the perfect cupcake and stout had a baby. I know that sounds horrible, but its the first thing it made me think. Beautiful lacing that lingers on the glass; soft and full on the palate, not to sweet, and I must repeat that it was a totally pleasant surprise. Yum.

pours dark brown to nearly black with minimal head that dissipates quickly. generous lacing lasts thoughout the pint. the mouthfeel, to me, is light for a stout but thats sort of nice because its not so heavy. nice choco malty afterglow that lingers on the palate. really tasty, eager to try more from this brewery.

This is a delicious beer. On tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington VT. Aroma is clean and citrusy; pours a lovely hazy light caramel amber with slow, lazy effervescence. Tight white head with impressive, sustained lacing that lingers all down the tulip. Hops aplenty dominate, medium mouth feel, finishes bitter and beautiful on the soft palate with a lingering piney creaminess on the roof of the mouth. Wow. Love.

I recently had this beer from a growler at a friends lake house and was lukewarm about it. I was hoping having it on tap that it might be better. Pours very yellow, slightly hazy with thin head that dissipated quickly. Virtually no lacing. I detect almost no aroma, but whats there is not offensive. Its a little hoppy for sure, but also a little bit sour. Feels light, if not fizzy, in the mouth. Someone else wrote here that it has a metallic taste on the mouth, and although thats not exactly how Id describe it, that comes close. Its not an awful beer, its just not the best BBC beer Ive had.

Pours yellowish light amber with 3/4"" head, light lacing that does not linger, and a little fizz. Pleasant and inviting aroma, nice mouth feel - I expected it to be lighter judging by the color, but it was a little more of a mouthful than its color might suggest. I like the bitter hoppiness of it and the citrus taste that lingers. Though its 8.6, it doesnt really have the boozy whallop that some other imperials do; definitely more ballsy than a regular pale but really quite right for the heat of summer.
