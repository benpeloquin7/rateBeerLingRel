You get the fruit taste and then a strong kick at the end of the pallets. Great beer I would recommend to a lot of friends.  ,90.031,Tums,Oregon,10.5%,Widmer Brothers / Cigar City Gentlemens Club - Rye Whiskey Barrel

I do have to say most of there selections are very tasty. This double IPA was fantastically smooth and less bitter compared to there shelter IPA. The smell was nice and fruity. Top layer tasted nice. These guys are definitely headed I the right direction. When I was in there I saw the owner trying what looked to be a new beer and It looked like a Hef so this should be exciting.  ,93.002,Tums,California,9%,Altamont Beer Works Hella Hoppy
