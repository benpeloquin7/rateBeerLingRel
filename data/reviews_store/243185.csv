yes maple syrup and bananas with a very light lime/lemon hop slight aftertaste. A bit too sweet for me. Might taste good on pancakes if you make a reduction.
Creamy and a smooth sweet caramel. Maybe plum/dried prune style honey on the palate. Low carbonation
Alcohol is well hidden for 8.3%. Very drinkable but in a maple marshmallow with a hint of lemon way. Cannot taste any wood or cherry but I finished a chimay a little while ago.
Still a well crafted beer but more of an aperitif type and having a one off is enough. Iwas thinking colder might be better but I suspect it would even intensify the honey sweet on the mouth.
