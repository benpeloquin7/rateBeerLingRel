Sweet coffee and chocolate flavors hit you at first followed by subtle vanilla. As the last bit hits the back of your throat you may feel a little tingle from the chili spices. The after taste is much the same as drinking a sweet stout. This beer is different but in a very good way. I highly recommend it to all stout drinkers and for those who dont drink stouts, this might change your mind. ",,fugmonkey,Florida,11%,Cigar City Hunahpus Imperial Stout
