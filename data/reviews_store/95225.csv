Not too sweet like many other brands Ive encountered, this dry cider is a perfect blend of applely goodness. I dont know what the girl below me is talking about, Strongbow is dry cider and is in no way sweeter than Woodchuck, Woodchuck is an overwhelmingly sugary domestic and pales in comparison to Strongbow. The Bow is extremely refreshing in the summer months, and goes very well with a big bowl of chili once autumn rolls around. It even tastes good after sitting out open on your dresser all night. In fact, Im drinking one right now. ",10.905,NikkiD,England,5%,Strongbow Cider
