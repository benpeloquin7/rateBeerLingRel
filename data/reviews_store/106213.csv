Solid creamy head that hung around for the first half of the glass.  The color is slightly more orange / amber than I expected for an IPA.  But thats probably all part of the Crystal malt used for balance which this beer does beautifully.  By the end of the glass I was surprised to find myself liking more.  Sometimes IPAs can overpower with hops making one enough.  Not this time.  I want another one! ,97.647,bluesbreaker,California,7.2%,Drakes IPA

I tend to look for a more balanced style like Pale Ale so Im a bit skeptical of West Coast massive IPAs.  But wow.  Stone IPA is a must drink beer.  Amazing hop balance between flavor, aroma and bitterness.  The bitterness is nicely balanced against the malt.  Somehow they have managed to get a strong hop profile that doesnt hang on too long.    The high rating on this beer is well deserved.  I cant believe Ive waited so long to try it. ",99.524,bluesbreaker,California,6.9%,Stone IPA (India Pale Ale)
