So Costco came out with their microbrews many years ago brewed by Gordon Biersch...and they were lets face it, about average if not a bit underwhelming. At $21.99 for a 48 can slab you really cant expect much more than a Coors Light clone. Theyve come pretty close, but all in all this is a light lager that should be considered so. 

Pours a brilliant light straw color, exceptionally clear with high carbonation evident in the pour. The head is average, white, dissipates fairly quickly, yet leaves a good deal of web-like lacing around the glass. Zero hop presence. Theres a slight briny-ness in the aroma and nothing more. Its a clean tasting light lager with no offensive or off tastes. Not overtly sweet or cloying like many other cheap lagers. The carbonation though strong at first dissipates quickly and the second half of the glass becomes somewhat flat. Minimal aftertaste...literally none. 

This is a fine example of what a domestic macro-light lager should be. Not my favorite style though, but well above average for what it is. Definitely a fine value if its what you are in the market for.  ",3.233,22415brewery,Washington,4.2%,Kirkland Signature Light Beer

NEARLY PERFECT. I am going to be bold and say that this beer very well could be this generations version of PLINY the ELder. It is THAT big and different. I bought this bottle on a whim, thinking that most other IPAs that feature galaxy hops tend to showcase the hop in a subtle way while blending in other American C-hops. This particular beer though brings forth the Galaxy in a very unapologetic way. Pouring a light copper, slight haze, with an average amount of head, one would never expect the BLAST of galaxy hops form the first sniff. Theres a deep dank-ness about the aroma, the tropical passion-fruit aromas hit you right in the nose-hairs! It is absolutely unapologetically tropical fruit. On a plus note, they did not f this one up by complicating the malt bill. The malt is simple, straightforward, a touch of caramel sweetness and a little bit of biscuit, but not much more. The bittering is incredibly smooth, no harsh cohumolone induced pucker faces or cat pee aromas. It is so smooth that it really just rolls off the tongue and implies a slight alkali-sensation. I wish more people could try this double IPA. This IPA should push brewing to the limits and do what Dogfish head 90 and Pliny the Elder did for the last 10 years.

Aroma is clearly Cascade hops that are somewhat restrained, the malt does not come forward in the nose. Flavor suggests at a touch of light caramel malt, but mainly clean american 2-row. There is very little hop flavor, however a smooth bittering that again is restrained. Light in body, flavor, bitterness, and finish. This overall is a very pleasant, drinkable, and unoffensive american pale ale, it however lacks in any outstanding qualities that would separate it from others. The 4.7% abv lies on the lighter side for most APAs and helps contribute to its sessionability, yet the hop flavor is one-dimensional and becomes quite boring.

Distinct coffee-like aromas, roasted barley, burnt toast, and some light caramel, no distinct hop presence. Medium bitterness and light sweetness help with a medium-light body. Taste is primarily coffee up front that is then followed by a light caramel and a slightly tart dryness. Toasted nutshells are also prominent in the flavor. A decent brown porter that leans more toward malt esters rather than heavy on roast and body. ",,22415brewery,Washington,6.8%,Hi-Fi Woofer Porter

Aromas of medium toffee, light caramel, chewy malt, and a slight bit of fruitiness. Medium mouthfeel gives way to a moderate amount of caramel sweetness, savory toffee, bit of raisin, along with a bit of diacetyl. A very light fruity and woodsy hop presence. Esters hint at either maris otter malt or Scottish ale yeast. Balance is good however there is a bit of astringency in the finish that detracts from the overall experience.

Finish leaves a lingering yeasty flavor, and body is medium-full. A below-average vienna lager beer that has some definite flaws. Cloudy appearance is disheartening.
