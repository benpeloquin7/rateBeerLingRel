The head is tan. The head retention is quite good. The alcohol is apparent in the smell. There is also a smell of carmel as well as licorice. The taste is malty and a little sour. There is a slight hint of molasses. There is something else, but I cant put my finger on it. This beer is quite full bodied. It goes down smooth. This beer might be hard to drink since it is so alcoholic, but give it time, and you might be able to drink a few in one night. This is a good beer, but there are imperial stouts out there that are, IMO, better. Definately worth a try though.

The head dissapears quickly. It smells biscuity with a little hint of spice. Maybe ginger. Also smells a little flowery. It tastes sweet with a great ballence of hops and malt. Maybe just a little more hoppy than malty. Very smoothe. Very, very good. This beer is a well rounded beer that can be enjoyed any time. You can easily drink a few of these beers at one time due to the somewhat low alcohol content. Only 5.2% I can not get this beer where I live, but only a few hour drive away, I can, so I usually stock up. I usually like dark, malty beers, but this is definately an exception. Definately worth a try.

It looks a little watery. The head dissapered quickly. This beer has hints of coffee and chocolate. It smells sweet. It tastes creamy. It has a sweet taste to it. There is very little alcohol taste to it. In my opinion, that is a defining atribute to an Imperial Stout. This beer goes down smoothly. It is not to bitter. It is easy to drink. The fact that the alcohol content is so low means that you could drink a few. I find myself going for the more malty beers, and this beer is a little lacking. I would probably drink this beer again if there were not any other more malty stouts available.

I was surprised to see a beer there that did not have a big ad campaign and a few bilboards. This beer looks dark brown in the glass. What little head there was disappered somewhat quickly. It smells slightly fruity. It doesnt taste much like I would expect any porter to taste like. Awfully thin. I was let down by how thin it was, as I like my beer thick and malty. It goes down pretty smoothly. As far as porters go, this one is lacking. It could use a more malty taste, and it could definitely use some thickening up. I will probably stay clear of this beer in the future.

This beer pours a thick tar like black. It has a dark brown head that fades a little fast. It leaves many laces. Absolutely no light shines through the murky depths of this beer.

This beer has a rich coffee like aroma. It smells very malty. Roasted barley is present. It has a dark chocolate aroma also. It smells slightly hoppy.

This beer has a strong chocolate like flavor. It tastes slightly of coffee. The alcohol content is apparent in the flavor. This beer is a little more hoppy than I expected. It has a small taste of dark fruits. Plumbs and rasins.

This beer is very thick. It is low in carbonation. It is surprizingly smooth, considering how massive a beer as it is. It leaves a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. The alcohol warms slightly as it goes down.

Although this beer is high in alcohol, I have had it as a session beer before. I get a little buzzed, but it works. I think I could drink this beerall week long. I would like to install a drinking fountain in my garage that pumps this beer out.
