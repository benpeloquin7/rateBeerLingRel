Burning River has a nice color and a hoppy aroma, with a hint of citrus. It has just enough bitterness without being overwhelming. Its good in the bottle, but even better at the Great Lakes brewery.

Overall the beer has a nice hazy, unfiltered appearance. Its a very drinkable, mild flavored beer.  I liked the slightly spicy citrus hint. With so many beers available I dont like drinking the same beer all the time, but Id certainly add Yokel to my everyday list of beers ",60.336,jayokel,Wisconsin,4.2%,New Glarus Yokel
