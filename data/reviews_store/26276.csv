Dark amber in color with very slight haze. Heavy, but not too thick. Sweet and malty flavor. I wasnt aware of the alcohol content until I looked it up on the brewery website- not obnoxious indeed! Great sipping beer- enjoyed the changes in taste and texture as it warmed up in my glass. ",92.936,atyeo,Pennsylvania,11.9%,Weyerbacher Quad
