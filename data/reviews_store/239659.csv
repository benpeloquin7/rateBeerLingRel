Smell is immediately dominated by hops

Pours black with finger of cream head

Taste is roasted coffee with tons of bitterness, but not hoppiness.
Would benefit from aging to mellow the bitterness a tad. Alcohol is well hidden. Some herbal licorice notes are apparent. Very tasty!

Coats the palate. Somewhat viscous but not as thick as other RIS out there

Overall well worth te $8.99 price. Ill drink it again. ",80.547,Beer_Sucks,Minnesota,9.5%,Brau Brothers Ivan The Great Russian Imperial Stout

Very little head and effervescence, especially compared to other Collesi beers. Looks like a fine red wine in the glass.

Taste is very fruity. Almost like a red wine, but with some biscuit-like malt on the finish, which is very clean. Some sweetness from sugar added for a secondary fermentation is a bit cloying, but doesnt ruin the beer.

smooth oily mouthfeel with a dry, clean finish.

Definitely worth the price tag (around $9.99) if you can find it. 

Bought at Rays Wine and Spirits in Wauwatosa
