The salicorne grows in the Somme marshland. In Britain we would call it samphire. 

Unfortunately unlike the de la Somme LArgousette beer I dont think the salicorne really adds anything. Maybe it makes it extra bitter. Possibly a little salty. Also a little grassy but basically nothing outstanding.

Beer pours well. Pale gold possibly a slightly green tint. My 33cl bottle was rather lively despite being past its June 2014 use by date.

Slight pale brown head. Aroma reminds me of the canned liquid malt you could buy from Boots in the 1970s for home brewing. Not a good memory! in fact it tastes a little like that although sweeter. I would never have bought this beer - it was given to me several years ago and I have kept putting off trying it. Until drinking I hadnt noticed it was a low alcohol beer. Too sweet for me but I get the festive idea. ,6.883,anglofrench,Denmark,1.9%,Ceres Julehvidtl
