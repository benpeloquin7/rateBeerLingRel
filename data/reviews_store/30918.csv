Read the review here, and tried it out closer to room temperature, and it tasted much better. Dark amber/red color, plenty of tan head going on. Tastes malty, with caramel, raisin flavor. Really great, but definitely wait till it warms up a bit. This beer is brewed with a similar formula to the famed Westvleteren 12, which Bernardus used to brew until they lost their contract. Definitely try this out, but listen to the advice of letting it warm up a bit. ",99.894,geekrobot,Belgium,10%,St. Bernardus Abt 12
