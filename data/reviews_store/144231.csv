Im a  big fan of Kona Brewing Companys ""Pipeline Porter"", however CCBs Cubano Espresso blows Pipeline away.  The aroma is heavenly, the taste is sublime, and the color is gorgeous.  It of course has the expected coffee flavor, however the kicker for me was the unexpected hint of chocolate.  Made for one very happy palette, indeed. I almost wish this were available as a near-beer so that I may enjoy it daily for breakfast :] ",98.405,ich_liebe_bier,Florida,5.5%,Cigar City Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale
