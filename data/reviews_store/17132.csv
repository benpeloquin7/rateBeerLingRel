Pours a deep, opaque black, deep brown head that stays put for a spell. Nose diving reveals rich and robust chocolate, almost like smelling dark chocolate syrup, hints of soy sauce, lots of roasted malt smells. First sip reveals wonderful flavors of roasted malt balanced with flavors of dark fruit and little to no hop flavor. Sipping more I get cherries, vanilla, and some delightful sweetness. I do love this stout and hop to pick up a younger one. Well balanced with no lingering flavor, making you want to keep going back.  ",99.788,Quyntarious,Norway,9%,Ngne  Imperial Stout
