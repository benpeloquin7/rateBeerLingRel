It is a cheap low strength can from Lidl. However it does win well when you want something cheap and cold and not too alcoholic in the middle of summer. This works well even after sauna and is better than that reindeer urine we have called Lapin Kulta. At the price for what you get it is a good deal as long as you manage your expectations ahead of time.

A bit of an acquired taste for many but it does make a change from the filtered similar lookalike breweries that hang on the coT tails of quality German brewing.
