The appearance was as expected for a spice beer of this nature with a light copper tone to it and a minimal rocky head.  The ale lacked the full body you would anticipate when thinking of a rich pumpkin pie, however the creamy texture and pleasing lingering finish of pumpkin pie spices and cinnamon more than make this a true session brew.
