I have a had multiple years of this beer all are very good. The flavors change as it ages. 08 was I felt the best very balanced and smooth. 09 was very light and smooth as well.  10 and 11 are both very good but will benefit from a couple years in the cellar. ,,Titusd84,Indiana,15%,Three Floyds Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout

Lots of bourbon and alcohol in the aroma.  The appearance is like used motor oil.  Just pitch black.  The taste is very sweet and a very strong bourbon flavor.  There is a little burn from the alcohol but that mellows as it ages. The palate is the best part of this beer.  It is a very thick stout. Overall BCS is outstanding. One of the best beers there is. ,,Titusd84,Illinois,14.2%,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout
