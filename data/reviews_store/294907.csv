Very deep dark ruby color, light carbonation. Nice rich aroma of vanilla, some dried exotic fruits even - reminds me of bourbon Makers Mark. Taste is very intense, complex, with lots of woody, vanilla, coconut notes, though alcohol isnt well hidden. Aftertaste is slight bitter, quite hard to drink. Overall - good BA beer, shall be better after ageing in bottles.  ",98.298,delr,Estonia,16%,Phjala Cellar Series - Odravein 2015 Bourbon BA

Quite intensive aroma of chocolate liquor, spices and licorice. Very sweet, with tons of spices, like star anise, cardamon, cinnamon, reminds of British Christmas pudding, some hints of strong booze, like whiskey or strong liquor. Would be great food pair both with verevorstid (estonian blood sausage with cowberry jam) and chocolate cake, but would prefer first. Excellent brew, but little bit too sweet.
