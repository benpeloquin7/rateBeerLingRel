Tart, overly sweet fake lemon flavored beer. Citrus, yeast, lemon drop with a mild beer after taste. Came across as more of a yeasty wine cooler to me. If you like the flavor of lemon drops and sweet drinks then this may appeal to you. I am pouring the rest down the drain.  ",9.048,Autumn1962,Missouri,4%,Shock Top Lemon Shandy

Flavor is of over ripe malty (?) bananas that lingers heavily on the palate. Somwht bitter. Heavy, hard to get down. I bought a variety case of Samuel Adams at Sams Club and was cursed with 4 bottles of this. I drank one and used the other three to make banana bread. If you happen to be stuck with this beer, just use it as your liquid in banana bread, dump it down the drain or give it away.  ",19.909,Autumn1962,Massachusetts,5.4%,Samuel Adams Hefeweizen
