I think it is really the ingenious use of ingredients that lend this beer its unique profile.  The hops are just right and blend nicely, the body is silky smooth, hinting that they possibly used oats to impart such a silky smooth texture.  The beer is high in alcohol, but it is very well hidden.  They hit a homerun on this one.  Now if you could only find it on the shelf.  I was lucky enough to get some at the Real Ale Fest from a firkin. (MapRoom, Chicago) ",,mneil9799,Indiana,15%,Three Floyds Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout
