Definitely not your everyday lager. The first thing I smell and taste is what I believe is either a cascade or a victory hop. Poured very nicely, with almost a golden Belgian-like Hefe hue, with little head. Very refreshing but not what I would call a grand slam. More points for originality.

It pours a deep dark amber color with a touch of red that wants to come out. Plenty of cherry notes in the aroma, but not too much in flavor. A perfect clean finish you would expect from this brewery.  ",98.566,PinkEchoes,New York,9.7%,Ommegang Three Philosophers
