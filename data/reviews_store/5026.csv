Started production in August &#8217;02, and I cant wait for the main hordes of you reviewers to get hold of it.

  Hugely tasty!  Very very vanilla-y, buttery and thick with caramel.  Sounds like a novelty brew?  Try it, you will not be disappointed. Its easily in my top 3 of real ales, possibly a Roaring Meg Beater... :)

  Well carbonated, copper body, with an average head of average colour and duration. The body is as thick as a toffee liquer (think Dooley&#8217;s), and there is a perfect bitter hop integration with all this.  The aftertaste is awash with notions; sweet irish cream, a woody smokyness, a citrus bitter note, smooth, soft, velvet maltiness and a long long warm vanilla-ness.

  Every mouthfull is literally a fantastic journey, I kid you not.  Its like drinking warm fudge, whilst eating shortbread after chewing on yeasty bubblegum!  Ok, it might not be to everyones taste but it is very different, and although I may have just put some people off, trust me, I cant see how you&#8217;d be dissapointed.... I love the bitterest and &#8216;realist&#8217; of the real ales, too, in case you thought I was a &#8220;sweet toothed&#8221; chap.  Bravo!

Quite a ""slight"" body given the alcohol percentage; think this puts a bit of an accent on the acidicness.
  Slightly earthy bread lies at the back of the throat with a buzzing citrus blast of delicate (but ^lots^ of) carbonation. Malty and rich with raisins / Appley (?) yeast. In fact, the style is a cross between a Westmalle Triple and an English Real Ale (possibly with a bit of the Original Hoegaarden 5% Wheat beer thrown in for good measure). 
  Lacking in novel factors, a little bit run-of-the-mill for a Belgium Triple... But then, compared to other beers from other countries...! ",54.552,mhoope01,Belgium,8%,Tongerlo 8 Tripel Blond

  Theres a toffee-apple type mouthfeel with this, and a corresponding wonderful aroma. Spritzy hits of hops are infused with sizeable portions of hot earth - a rare brew being both hoppy and malty at the same time. 
  As a CBM64 Waveform? Hugh attack, long delay, great sustain and a mellow release... A calm, quiet finish of chewing gum hints and elderberry grapishness. Not all top rate though, its not a blue Chimay, and can be a bit sour, and ""winey"". ",57.318,mhoope01,Belgium,6.5%,Tongerlo 6 Bruin / Brune

Chunky yet mild carbonation is a part of the package, too.
  Consists of Malt, Barley Stuff, wheat and interesting hopes -- that provide whispy notes of creaminess and dont ever really stray into bitter categories.
  The malts taste of blood red oranges, and on another fruit side note there is a little touch of a smokey pear in there. On the down side, it is wet and tarty,  and no yeast apparent to do any talking. The story doesnt get any better though, it gets skunky and hard going in the later stages - I only just noticed that it contains malted barley from Scotland (I HATE SCOTTISH BEERS) -- could explain why it is going down more and more slowly.

Very chocolatey, bitter tart to start (does improve with warming to room temperature), with a good yeasty nose.
