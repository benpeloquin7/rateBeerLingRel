Smells sweet, hints of citrus and flowers.  A malty beer that tastes mild and sweet , no real taste of alcohol or hops.  Noted hints of bananas.  The most unpleasant thing about this beer was the lack of cascade hops.  

Its a great beer for its style and paired well with a mild curry and Garlic Naan.

Drinking this beer from a bottle would butcher it.  Not my favorite style of beer but darn good tasting for what it was.  I have to disagree with the previous posts and scarcely believe that we are even rating the same beer.  I dont think that many of the other tasters gave this beer a good tasting (out of a glass) with a clear pallet.  Most beers are going to taste watery when paired with spicy foods.

This beer is certainly worth trying once. ",5.428,aves80,India,4.7%,Flying Horse Royal Lager Beer
