Light copper colour, off-white head. Malty, herbal, hint of citrus, bitter not so pleasant. As a home brewer i think i recognize the use of dry yeast, Fermentis. The test we have done gives a really bitter, long lasting, unpleasant taste. The older the beer get the more unpleasant. I am sad to say that i taste this in most of the swedish craft brews of today. Sad! Why cant you use fresh and healthy yeast??  Amarillo is a low co-humulone variety and should not be bitter. Fresh yeast pls. ",96.251,hravnsvarte,Sweden,5.9%,Oppigrds Amarillo

Body is light, texture thin-oily, carbonation is average. Long finish with a low bitterness.
Overall a nice first commercial try. I do miss some complexity from special malts. Used white sugar? Some sourness from something. Ok

Bubblegum with citrus notes. I can scent some butterscotch, diacetyl?? Hopefully not meaning this ale is on its way to go bad. Its pleasant though. A rest product from fermenting??
Color is hazy and coppery. Taste is a balanced whit a long a fresh bitterness that lingers on and on, for a long time.
A lovely IPA, that tastes homebrewed, in the best positive way. With passion and for your best friends.
