Ive had this beer on tap at local pubs and go out of my way to get 6-packs of the 16 oz cans to keep the fridge stocked at home.  (Dont let the cans age more than about 6 weeks; even if you keep them chilled they can go flat on you.)
The guy that said it was over-carbonated must have bought it right off the delivery truck or his distributor didnt keep it chilled; this stuff is smooth and generally pours very calm.  Nice thin head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass.  Bold, bready malt flavor with just the right hint of hop finish (not an over-hopped IPA).

Hands-down the smoothest, creamiest, slightly sweet choco/java stout I have ever tasted.  The menu did not mention cream/milk, but I suspect this brew has some in it.
Initial tap has bubbles dispersed throughout, settling to a thick creamy head of about 1/2"" within a minute. Settles into a constant 1/4"" head that just hangs in there, even when you only have a 1/4"" of beer in the botton of the glass.  Beer is a nice opaque black/brown - looks almost as good as it tastes.
No bottles or growlers for take-home, so I had a second pint.  Will have more any (every) time I return to Montreal.

Light on the palate as any Weiss beer should be, but full-bodied roasted malt flavor (think of a blend between classsic Heffe Weissen and a good Nut Brown Ale).  Thick and cloudy - typical for the unfiltered nature of this type.  Very well done (but save room for a pint of the Stout Imperial).

Pours a deep rich dark brown (almost black) with a light brown head.  Roasted barley flavor with hints of molasses/caramel.  Very smooth-drinking beer.

This should probably be re-classified as an Old Ale.
