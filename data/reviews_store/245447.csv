Unlike other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had, this one picks up a slight amount of bourbon flavour, but this one is more steered to the coffee flavor.  A smooth finish with the aroma and taste of coffee give this stout something different.  The color is nice and dark and pours with a nice head formed on top.  Almost want to add a drop of cream to this delicious stout. ",74.061,hardypc,Kentucky,8%,Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout
