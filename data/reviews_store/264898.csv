It dominates parties, stag nights, summer fests, grill fests. Paradox thing is that Augustiner does not make any commercials at all. Taste is Medium-malty. It is in general sold as 0,5 liter in restaurants and pubs. Households buy it in 0,5 liter single bottles or crates with 20 bottles. Pubs do serve it in general from an aluminium keg. At special occacions they do have it from a wooden barrel. ",43.2,fischassel,Germany,5.2%,Augustiner Lagerbier Hell
