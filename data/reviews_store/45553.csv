Leichtus weiss, meaning light, not a mistake; I do think its a little sulfury-not sulfur dioxide as in rotten eggs. Crushable throughout any summer; morning, day, or night. Some rock-like hed throughout, smellings of faint banana, slight spice of clove, wheat, and an earthy mineral thing with the sulfur. High carbonic bite which brings these flavors and senses together in a german lawnmower way, I think. ",,AndyAle,Illinois,3.5%,Piece Light n Curvy

Resin when I sniff it, resin coated the eyeball when gazing at the cloudy 12 oz. tulip; before it even hit the tongue I could tell there was going to be some sort of resiny stickiness that might try to seal my lips after one sip. This deceptive stickiness obviously  confused the poor soul who rated this last,as it is not an underattenuated residually sweet DOUBLE IPA; quite dry in fact. One question KeithD, have you ever actually done that with a Sierra? Nice comparison, really, if you havent I think you should try that, and then try this beer again.

Some of the subtle characteristics Im sure will in time become more pronounced. Aroma of clove and the usual Belgian suspects, a malty chocolate following, and a truly faint citrusy hop; some alcohol as it warms up. Appears garnet with light, but a dark chocolate to black in the dimmer lighting. So many things going on in the mouth (ifyaknowhatimean), fruity esters, woody textures, chocolate malt, dates with prunes and such. Nice dry finish after the flavor assault, which still coats the entire mouth, and it lacks zero body. All in all I just liked it alot for what it was and would like to see what more it becomes!
