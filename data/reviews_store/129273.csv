Quite a subtle aroma: citrus and spicy, but not in large amounts.  The appearance is dense cloudiness, with a fine white head.  Has quite a watery taste, a little too sweet.  Rather an uninspiring beer. ",47.262,brianlavelle,Belgium,4.5%,Lefebvre Blanche de Bruxelles

Appearance is a rich deep red/darkbrown hue: very appealing, with a big frothy head.  The taste reminded me somewhat of Belgian dubbels or tripels: deep, rich and quite earthy.
