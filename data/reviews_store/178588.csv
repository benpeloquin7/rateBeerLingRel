Pours an almost impenetrable black. Aromas of coffee and heavy cacao on the nose. Has a sweet scent, yet a heavy alcohol presence. First sip was a delight, having a lot more coffee than I had anticipated. Chocolate rolls off the back of the palate and a decent alcohol burn towards the end. Strong for a porter, and very flavorful in general.  ",99.788,comedybeazle,California,10%,Ballast Point Victory at Sea
