The Amarillo hops do a very good job at masking the sorghum off-sweetness that has become infamous amongst G-frees. Appearance is a classic pilsner straw colour. Coming from a gluten-intolerant individual this is a real throwback to the days having a heavily light-struck Stella or Moosehead on a hot day. Until something else comes along Id probably say this is the best Gluten Free beer Ive had. ,20.038,lvanbelkom,England,4.2%,St Peters G-Free
