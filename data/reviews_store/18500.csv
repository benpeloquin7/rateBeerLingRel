Im surprised it isnt rated higher.  Good sturdy head.  Nice and malty initially and then a pleasant hoppy finish.  Good balance between the sweet malt and bitter hops.  Going to try this with a NY strip steak next time.  Im thinking this will be an excellent pairing.  ,88.545,wowbagger68,Oregon,6.2%,Rogue Dead Guy Ale
