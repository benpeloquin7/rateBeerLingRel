Tastes hoppy and chocolates, some bready notes. Some sweetness with mild coffee. Really nice.

Citrus and Pine all the way, followed by some light crusty bread notes. Finish nice and dry, perfect balance of bitter and malt.

 Crisp and refreshing, not to boozy, but it does show through a little.

The nose on this one has an odd funkiness too it, its really hard to explain I almost want to say metallic funk. Apples are present as well.

Taste is slightly sour with a huge apple flavor. Think sour apple jolly rancher and you have a good idea. Personally I enjoyed it, probably wont be for all though.

Crisp and refreshing, definetely a good summertime brew.

Overall I enjoyed it as I enjoy almost all of Lindemans offerings. ",46.592,scottyg354,Belgium,3.5%,Lindemans Apple (Pomme)
