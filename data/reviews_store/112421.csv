Bourbon aroma is very prominent. Sweet bourbon aroma, rather soft boozieness. Big chocolate and caramel aromas meld seamlessly with the bourbon. Moderate roast and vanilla noted. 

The flavor starts out bourbon heavy before a healthy dose of chocolate floods the palate. A rather assertive roasted malt flavor begins to emerge on the midpalate. The caramel flavor is much more subtle in the bottle version than on tap. Flavors are well integrates though not nearly as much as the tap version. A bit of heat on the back is noted but not obstructive. 

Full bodied Imperial Stout. The carbonation levels are low and appropriate. Very silky, soft texture. The finish is long and enjoyable.

Reviewed from a bottle this time to compare the the tapped version. Unfortunately I do not know the age of the keg, the tap version does seem slightly smoother. Very drinkable Imperial Stout.

Soft pale wheat malt backed by a pleasant lemony scent. There is a slight grassiness just behind. Very simple and straight forward.

The flavor, much like the aroma, is rather simple. Many time simplicity is viewed in a negative light, seen as dull or uninteresting. Maybe it is just me and my soft spot for this beer but I appreciate the simplicity. Wheaty malt flavor melds with a lemony tartness. The flavor will not satisfy someone looking for a Berliner Weiss, but that is not what Bells brewed. What Bells brewed was a slightly tart wheat session beer, and did rather well with it.

Very light bodied beer, carbonation is on the high side and appropriate for the beer. Lively carbonation felt on the tongue. The finish is dry and refreshing.

The aroma balances the warm malt and sticky hops rather well. Toasted malt base followed by a substantial amount of caramel. The aroma gets a bit deeper with the addition of some cocoa scents. Resinous pine and sweet citrus hop aromas provide a counterpoint to the sizable malt bill. 

The flavor begins rather malt forward. Heavy on the caramel malt, warm bread and a soft dark chocolate flavor develop moving back. Piny hop flavor melds with the dark malt to display a somewhat earthy flavor. Citrus flavor emerge from beneath lightening the flavor a bit. Very smooth bitterness

Medium bodied Imperial Red. The carbonation is moderate and appropriate. Very soft gentle feel on the tongue. The finish comes up just short of being long.

The flavor is a bit brighter than the aroma. The chocolate flavor is much more developed. Chocolate blends with a smooth creme sweetness. Roast lies beneath, subtle flavor counterbalancing the sweetness.

Hop forward aroma. Assertive tropical fruit backed by pleasant citrus and soft floral aroma. Wheat malt backs and balances the hops. Less of a grainy aroma than many American Pale Wheats, there is a rather pleasant sweetness.

The hops are allowed to take center stage upfront. Sweet pineapple flavor leads followed by subtle grapefruit and a general citrus sweetness. The bitterness is rather low, though there is enough to provide balance. Soft malt sweetness rounds out behind. The soft wheat provides a nearly perfect combination for the fruity hop flavor.

The bodied falls on the lighter side of medium. Fairly crisp carbonation. Moderate but refreshing finish.

Gumballhead is a fantastic beer. While it is not one I reach for often when it is available to me, I also enjoy it when I do.

Bright fresh hop aroma oozes from the glass. Sweet citrus aroma is followed by a fair amount of green grace and fresh floral aromas. Subtle pale malt sweetness lies beneath.

The bright citrusy aroma carries through to the flavor. Orange and tangerine flavors are fresh and juicy up front. The fresh floral earthy flavors from the fresh hops are present just behind. Soft bitterness, much more complimentary than biting. The malt is subtly sweet but overshadowed by the hops for the most past. 

Medium body Pale Ale. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate. The texture is almost creamy, I find this rather enjoyable. The finish winds up on the shorter side.

A fantastic wet hopped beer, I hesitate very little to say this is my favorite hoppy option from Arcadia. Bright assertive flavors while refraining from ever becoming overpowering extremely drinkable, very enjoyable.

An assertive tartness is picked up right off the bat. A bright cherry flavor develops just behind, the transition is seamless. The oak comes into play on the midpalate. The oak dries out the flavor a bit and helps some more subtle flavor emerge. Soft earthy flavor noted on the back of the palate. A grape like tartness lingers long after the swallow.

Strong chocolate aromas greet the nose up front. The chocolate is backed by a substantial boozieness. Deep roast and caramelized sugars can be found just behind adding some depth. A touch of molasses can be noted on the back end. 

The flavor is rather similar to a chocolate liqueur. The chocolate is assertive but not overpowering while the booze seems to present itself at an appropriate level just behind. The roast cuts through leaving a dark roasted coffee flavor. The combination of the sweeter chocolate and the heavy roast works rather well. Deep molasses flavor lingers in the background.

The body rests somewhere on the lower side of full. Not quite as thick as I would have imagined. Carbonation is moderate, it may work better if it were toned down a bit but it is appropriate where it sits. The finish is long, heavy chocolate and roast flavors dig in and linger on the tongue.

The head works its way back in short order leaving a ring around the snifter. A moderate amount of lacing is left elegantly clinging to the walls of the glass. 

The aroma is bright and lively, as macerated raspberries flood the nose. Brewing with fruit can present a challenge to many brewers, even when using fresh product the aroma can appear rather artificial. Founders excels with their use of fruit, pulling out every ounce of fresh berry aroma available. Buried beneath the fruit lies subtle Belgian yeast notes. Slightly peppery, soft phenols meld perfectly into the fruit.

The Flavor displays intensity and restraint. The first sip tastes like a spoonful of homemade raspberry preserves. Strong berry sweetness with an underlying tart finish. The flavor opens up more with warmth, a darker berry sweetness develops and a warming alcohol presence can be felt. While the fruit flavor is dominant the sweetness is held in check, never approaching a cloying level.

Full bodied Belgian ale is very smooth and luscious on the tongue. The carbonation is low allowing the beer to roll elegantly across the tongue. The finish is long and lingering, the succulent raspberry flavor digs deep into the tongue. 

Blushing Monk is a damn good beer, I am very happy to see once again. Certainly not an every day drinker, this is one you want to keep on hand for a special occasion. The flavor is rich and decadent, certainly a sipper. Founders delivers far more than a simple fruit beer, even if you are not normally a fan of the style you owe it to yourself to try this one out.

Deep ruby colored body with a bit of tarnished brown creeping in. Slightly hazed body though no sediment noted. One and a half finger eggshell colored head set atop. The head diminishes rather quickly, scant lacing left behind. Good looking beer but not top tier. 

The aroma is heavy on the fig and caramel. Deep rich caramelized sugar stops just short of burnt. Brighter raisiny and plumb aroma develops underneath. Soft spiciness is picked up underneath but the overall aroma is dominated with sweet caramel and fig.

The flavor is similar to what you would expect from the nose. The sweetness is a bit more subdued than what I imagined however. The caramel melds with a molasses flavor. The fig and fruit flavor is much darker and more integrated. I really enjoy the sweetness being held in check, makes the beer much more enjoyable and easy to drink. 

Medium to full bodied beer, carbonation is moderate and appropriate. Very soft texture. The finish is on the longer side but fades sooner than you might imagine. 

Tasty beer overall. I am not sure if this is one I would pick up again, it is more about my feeling about the style rather than the beer. Enjoyable and rather drinkable. Holding up well, worth a try if you can find it lying around.

The nose blends and interesting combination of chocolate, dark fruit and bright citrus. Rich chocolate, deep caramel and subtle molasses aromas greet the nose. Just behind the dark fruit aroma comes out. The raisin and prune scents merge with the chocolate up front beautifully. On the back a brighter citrus aroma provides some levity to the overall bouquet.

The flavor is not exactly what you would expect from the aroma. The same characteristics are picked up the the balance and intensity vary a bit. Chocolate flavor develops first but immediately transitions into a heavy caramelized sugars then on to a raisin and prune flavor. The flavor brightens a bit as it moves back. An underlying citrus sweetness combines with a sweet raisin flavor on the back. A lingering combination of chocolate, burnt sugar and sweet raisin remain after the swallow.

Medium to full bodied, a big beer but lacks viscosity. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate. Slightly slick texture left on the tongue. Finish is fairly long.

The aroma swings towards the sweet side. Prominent caramel , chocolate comes in just a bit lower. The bourbon is rather assertive but non offensive. Slight vanilla lingers beneath. Each individual scent is very pleasant but the overall aroma lacks depth. 

Sweet bourbon and caramel dominate the palate. The flavor is much more bourbon than beer. The chocolate is very subtle, there is a rather strong vanilla flavor. The bourbon flavor is pleasant but far too strong to work in appropriately this beer. 

Medium bodied stout, carbonation is moderate to low but appropriate. There is a slight creaminess to the body but the beer really hurts from a lack of viscosity. 

Overall Cincinnatus is a worthy beer however it lacks a few important aspects I need to see before I start comparing it to the top tier beers in the style. There is a lack of depth in the flavor and aroma, a stronger roasted malt presence would really help. My two biggest knocks are the thin body and excessive bourbon flavor. These areas that are lacking do not ruin the beer but they are not doing them any favors. Very easy to drink, I would drink more in the future but not going to be the first -bal stout I grab.
