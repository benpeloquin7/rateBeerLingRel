Its not the best beer by far but it serves its purpose well. especially if you know how to drink it!
THE SECRET: Only drink this beer cold and in the can.
If you do this, you will be pleasently surprised,... and tickled at the price you paid for it.
Ya, it doesnt have the best aroma, or colour, and it doesnt give head. Thats why it comes in a can, so leave it in the can, chill and enjoy! ",6.883,lagernale,Canada,5%,Pine Creek Hek Lager
