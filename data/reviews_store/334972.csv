Aroma nice and fruity but not as strong as most ""hoppy"" advertised beers, smell compares to Ithaca Flower Power.
Appearance: has the look of a very high end IPA adequate head, lots of lace left on the glass.. Respectable appearance
Taste: honey on the tip, sweet, malty.. Finishes with a dogfish 60 min amount of hops.
Palate:more carbonated than most IPA beers, which doesnt allow the complex flavors coat the tongue .. 
Overall: its a beer thats presentation not quality markets this beer. It isnt bad, but isnt anything spectacular. Buy a sixer of Daves pale ale, and get a little better beer imho.. Bottleing has a wow factor that could intrigue even the biggest beer snob you know.. Enjoy the beer it isnt bad at all. ",84.908,upstatehophead,New York,6.8%,Blue Point Hoptical Illusion
