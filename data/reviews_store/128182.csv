Had this on cask, 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  Hazy golden, typical looking cask head on this one, decent lacing on the glass.  Dont get much aroma on it honestly, but it tastes nice enough.  Grassy, with some light citrus hints too.  Would gladly order this anywhere I saw it on cask.  Better mouthfeel and texture than was expected too.

Intrigued to see how a 3.7 APA holds up.  Nice sticky head on top of a lagerish looking golden beer, slightly darker I suppose.  Smell is good, citrus mainly, American hops are pretty obvious, no real malt comes out.  Taste is nice, lots of citrus, orange marmalade comes to mind mostly, slightly harsh aftertaste, could deal with some more malt substance to the beer.  Good mouthfeel though, not too thin like a lot of these seem to be.  Overall if you find this, especially freshly tapped give it a try! ",,cfh_nc_uk,England,3.7%,Wentworth American Pale Ale

Smell is not much, some caramel and toast I suppose. Taste is not impressive, almost apply and I cant get past the oxidation.  I think this is in very bad condition, which is confirmed by the fact that it is no longer available as I finish the pint.  I think it had potential to be an average bitter, nothing special, and certainly didnt get any ""spicy"" hops. ",32.898,cfh_nc_uk,England,4%,J.W. Lees Dragons Fire (Cask)
