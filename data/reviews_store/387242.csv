Appearance - Bright, golden orange with a fluffy white to off white head. 

Taste - Up front hops balanced by the malt and rye spice that works very well together. Slight warming from the alcohol but very balanced and hop forward. Everything an IPA pushing 10.5% should be.

Palate - Medium to lite mouth feel, dry beer that finishes without much residual sweetness. Well fermented and crisp. 

Overall - If this was available in Florida, this would be a go to double IPA for me. Its delicious and refreshing. Its all the great things a west coast IPA has brewed in the north east.  ",,MattMCB,Rhode Island,10.5%,Revival Conga Imperial IPA
