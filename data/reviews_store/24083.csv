The appearance was a ruby color.  The flavor was obnoxiously sweet and almost had an oxidized flavor which sat on the palate with no hop and malt balance.  I feel this is one of the worst beers I have had and an insult to the great brewery.

I usually drink it in the big bomber bottle.  I was amazed to discover that this beer is as good as the best IPAS you will find on tap.  In many bottled IPAS the beer is much different than on tap.  There tends to be an excess of bitterness and lack of malt balance.  However, the 90 minute is very well balanced with the hops not overtaking the malt.  Also, there was no diacetyl or oxidation in any of the bomber bottles I have tasted.

It has captured the wine and beer world simultaneously.  Because it uses muscat grapes which are used for white wine and combines it with a belgian tasting yeast and malt,  you get an oak taste while eliminating the excessive sweet and sour taste of wine.  The grape, hops, malt, and yeast round out the beer giving the drinker the great sweetness of wine and the crisp bitterness of a malty ale.
