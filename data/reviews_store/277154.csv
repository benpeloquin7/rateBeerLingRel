Aroma is hop forward with rich roasted finish. Mouthfeel and flavor are all a step up. Nothing to complain about here; far better than your average imperial stout.

Served only slightly cooled. It seems to pour thin and with minimal head. Appearances are deceiving, however, as the rich roasted flavor starts with a nice amount of hops. The finish is smooth and the mouthfeel belies the thin lacing. As good as advertised and not to be missed on a cold winter&apos;s night.
