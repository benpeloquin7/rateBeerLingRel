Sweet and citrusy hop aroma with some tropical fruit notes. Incredible aroma. Sweet and citrusy  hop flavor well balanced with maltiness. The finish is strongly bitter and hoppy. Best IPA Ive had to date. I expected a strong alcohol presence, but it wasnt there. Medium bodied, remarkably smooth and slightly dry.
