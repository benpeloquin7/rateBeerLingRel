Aroma: slight bourbon, coffee, sweet, caramel, earthy
Appearance: light in color for a stout, medium brown,minimal head
Taste: medium sweet, coffee, dark chocolate, light bourbon
Palate: medium body, thick texture, light carbonation, bitter coffee finish
Overall: As a bourbon drinker, this beer did not deliver on the bourbon barrel favors expected in a beer aged in bourbon barrels, the stout qualities of this beer are overwhelmed by the coffee flavors and failed to meet my expectations for a stout in this price range. The coffee used as an addition to this beer overwhelm the bourbon and take away from the roast of the stout. Overall a decent beer to drink but dont put it on my tab.

Aroma: dark malt, caramel, light roasted coffee, hops- not obtuse, herbal with a slight bitter scents
Appearance: as above, medium dark caramel color
Taste: up front burnt caramel that dissipates to leave bitter, pleasant citrus hop flavor slight alcohol in the back of the throat, lasting finish of hops
Palate: medium thick, full bodied, rolls nicely over the tongue finishing in the back of the throat ,warming and inviting to another sample
Overall: my first rating...I tried this style to see if a black IPA could deliver the promise of being dark enough to satisfy the oatmeal sweetness of an oatmeal stout, and the bitterness of an IPA in the same brew...overall delivers on a partial promise, while nicely balanced, this brew did not satisfy the stout I expected but exceeded my expectations on the hoppy bitterness I would expect from a true IPA. Overall a nice concept but not yet fully developed...I would recommend this beer as a transition from fall to winter. ",91.779,Bushwackzaq,California,6.8%,21st Amendment Back in Black
