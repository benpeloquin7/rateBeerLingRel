This beer is fantastic. While I was in Lucan, MN, I decided to swing by and pick up a bottle. I pourded it from the Bottle and into a snifter. The Templeton Rye Whiskey is present and noticable. However, the whiskey flavor blends extremely well and doesnt overpower the other flavors. In fact, I much perfer this beer over Backwoods Bastard by Founders. Overall, this beer is one of the best Brau Brother Beers that I have ever had and I will definately purchase this beer again if I can find it.
