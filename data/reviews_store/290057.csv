Pours pitch black with low, beige and short head. Beer stays on sides of the glass when swirled.
Aroma is very intense with notes of smoke, campfire, dried plums, chocolate, coffee, chicory coffee, roastiness and some alcoholic hints.
Taste is very well balanced. Chocolate sweetness devolves into coffee-like and roasty bitterness very smoothly with nice smokiness and plummy sourness in the background.
Full body. Oily and smooth texture. Low and smooth carbonation.
With all my love for Browar Pinta, their Imperator Batycki is outclassed by this one. Its a definition of a Baltic Porter. Definitely best Ive ever had and probably the best on the earth right now. ",,Pelzky,Poland,11%,Kormoran Imperium Prunum
