The tartness definitely caused this one to be a real sipper for me since I am not used to this style of beer yet. Body was about light to medium with a crisp feel to it.

I will have to try and figure out more with my other bottle. The flavor was similar with a strong chocolate taste and notes of roasted malt and espresso. Dark fruits were also in the mix as well as some earthy hops. The finish was a mixed of roasted malts, hop bitterness and a slight alcohol bit. Excellent all around flavor that I couldnt ask any more of. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Damn good drinkability here. Great all around Russian Imperial Stout that is near the top of my favorites.

Poured out an opaque black with a tall light brown head that dies down quickly leaving some lace around the glass. Aroma is full of dark chocolate and a bit of roasted coffee. The flavor was similar with a bittersweet chocolate up front and roasted coffee flavors coming on strong as well. There were notes of earthy hops and this beer ended with a lingering roasted coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was about medium with good drinkability. Pretty good example of the style. ,97.373,meathookjones,California,5.8%,Firestone Walker Walkers Reserve

Appearance in the glass is a dark amber color with about a half-inch of beige head that dies down quickly to a random scattering of bubbles. Left a bit of lace as well as it was consumed. Sweet malt and fruity notes dominated the aroma. Notes of molasses were present as was a bit of alcohol as this warmed. Sweet tasting upfront and a bit of molasses and alcohol lingering in the background. Also there were notes of dark fruits and a slight alcohol bite on the aftertaste. It was sweet but not cloying as the alcohol and hops kept that in check. Almost full bodied this was rich and coating in the mouth. Tasty stuff that I have drank several of upon occasion and a release I always look forward each year. ",96.648,meathookjones,Delaware,11.4%,Dominion Millennium

The head stuck around for a bit and left rings of lace as this was drank. The aroma was yeasty with a bit of spice and a lemony zip to it. Also there was a good amount of sweetness present in the nose. The flavor started off with doughy malt and lemony notes and a bit of banana. There were also notes of various spices through that taste. It finished with a dry spicy after taste. Mouthfeel is medium and feels pretty heavy on the tongue. This is pretty tasty and wheat beers are usually not my thing, but I could drink a lot of this if I was in the mood. Great example of the style and a great beer.

This came out a hazy golden yellow with a slight white head. Small traces of lacing were left around the glass as it was consumed. The nose was spicy, fruity and a bit of sweetness in there as well. Slightly spiciness up front is joined by a fruity sweetness as well as mild earthy hop notes. Aftertaste leaves a bit of spice lingering on the tongue. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp with a body that is a bit lighter than I would have expected. Drinkability was good as I had three of these and wanted more. This is a good example of the style but not my favorite, I will probably go back and pick up a growler before it is gone though. ",,meathookjones,Delaware,,Dominion Triple

This poured out a murky golden color with a tall beige head. The head lasts a good bit and decent sized chunks of lace were left about the glass, as it was consumed. Very hoppy nose here with citric grapefruit and floral notes galore. Not much else came through just hops, hops and more hops. The flavor was damn hoppy as well, bitter citric hops mainly dominated with a bit of earthy notes as well. This really grabs you tongue and doesnt let go very much the palette destroyer that ends in a long lasting dry bitter hoppy finish. Hmm this is pretty light on the tongue for a Double IPA, with a less than medium body to it. Drinkability is hurt a little by the lighter body but it is still good. I would definitely have this again, as the flavor definitely packs the hops you are looking for in this type of brew. ",99.736,meathookjones,California,8.2%,Stone Ruination IPA
