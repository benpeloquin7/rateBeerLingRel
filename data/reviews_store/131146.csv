It seemed  to lean toward a medium bodied average beer for this category.  Lively carbonation.  The high octane 9% a.b.v. has that going in its favor ;>}  Paid almost $12.00 for a six pack.  Would like to see Lake Louie Brewing provide brew date information on the bottle or label, but perhaps since its a seasonal brew it may not matter?

The aroma was rather neutral.  Perhaps a hint of hops but that may be a subjective decision on my part.  Nice deep reddish brown color.  Complex blend of rich sweet malts.   No strong alcohol taste despite the high 8. 5% A.B.V.  Quite smooth with a full palate feel.  Light carbonation.  Overall this beer is a must have keeper. ,97.373,Chevami,Michigan,8.5%,Founders Dirty Bastard Scotch Ale
