Drank this rather quickly on the brewery tour. Nice toffee colored head when I picked it up off the bar. A medium amber in color. Well balanced with a smooth finish. What is to be expected out of a Vienna Lager. Only 1 fault!! Not enough to drink!!! ,63.158,beerlyman,Georgia,5.5%,5 Seasons Seven Sisters Mnchner
