This is mead. You do not use wheat or barley or hops, you use water and honey. This is not a beer and you cannot compare it to a beer, it is a category all in itself. 

I rated this mead based on this experience alone, although I feel I should give it a higher mark to offset the low ratings from some people who dont really understand what mead is. That being the case, I must now second guess every other rating for every beer on this website due to lack of knowledge of the beer that is being rated. This is my first entry, I feel I have to defend this one because I feel so highly about it. 

Locally here in Memphis we have a growler store, I picked up a half-gallon and brought it home and poured it into a snifter. Naturally, allow it to breathe for a bout 3 to 5 minutes and check the nose. Immediately I smell beeswax and clover honey, there is a very subtle hints of citrus and Jasmine. On the mouth feel, it is very light and crisp, sharp carbonation, almost
Champagne like, flavors of honey, lemon zest, hints of rice cake(seriously). The very first taste is not as impressive as I would hope but the following sips lead to a brighter and more round flavor. The finish is quite dry, unexpected yet quite satisfying. It reminds me of a dry white wine with a slight sweetness to it. Not a homemade mead yet it doesnt taste mass produced. $10 for a 64 ounce draft growler is well worth my money and a nice break from beer. I recommend to anyone not delving into Bud or Coors as their go to beer.  ",13.577,Fishhead1227,Oregon,5.2%,Rogue Farms 19 Original Colonies Mead
