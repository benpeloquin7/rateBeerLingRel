Beer pours very nice leaving a finger width head that quickly disappears. No lacing what so ever. Aroma is that of alcohol, very heavy alcohol smell. Not a lot of smoky aroma that is symbolic of a scotch. I love scotch ales and this is not a scotch ale. It reminded me of drinking original Nyquil. I poured 3/4 of the growler down the drain, I couldnt drink it. Maybe if the ABV was lowered and more malt and hops added it could be called a beer. I have had and made better beer than this. For a brewery that makes beer for a living...this is bad, very bad. ",,wyocoalminer,Wyoming,8.7%,Black Tooth Scotch Wee Heavy Ale
