The toasy malt character is amazing, I love that in a beer.  Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a lacy off-white head.  The beer itself has an amazing malt profile, with a great balance.  This beer won first place in the Brown category at the World Beer Cup, so that tells you something.  This is quite a beer.  This is year round on tap at the brewery.

Extemely floral and citrusy.  The beer pours a deep, hazy orange color, with a very nice lacy head.  The flavor is intense.  You can smell the freshness of the hops from two feet away. The malt character is perfectly balanced with the intensity of the hops.  This beer is definately up there with the leading double/imperial ipas.  This is a great beer to introduce you to the new summit hops.   I love it!!  Enjoy ",95.1,jaustin72403,Illinois,7%,Flossmoor Station Imperial Dwarf IPA

Very well balanced, the oatmeal really comes out in the flavor.  I am a huge fan of Founders Breakfast Stout, and this is the one beer that I have had that I can compare with it.  Flossmoor should definately consider Bourbon Barrelling this beer, I think it would turn out amazing.   ",84.6,jaustin72403,Illinois,5%,Flossmoor Station riseNshine Coffee Oatmeal Stout
