Not that its bland, but its a very well-balanced and refreshing lager that has some nice light hops. Carbonation perhaps a bit high. Love the old-style label too.

and one that is almost perfect for my intended purpose of camping. Its cheap and has a nice
clean taste with just a bit of hops, nothing much, but still pleasant. Also one of the palest yellow beers Ive
seen and has no aroma. Still, to me, this is what a cheap beer should be.

dodgy hops come to the fore. And it is extremely watery and highly carbonated. The finish is non-existant and the aftertaste is a shocker, 
kind of like cardboard or corn or something. In this case I think no taste would be better than bad taste. 
I wish this wasnt such a popular beer, being from Brisbane its everywhere.
