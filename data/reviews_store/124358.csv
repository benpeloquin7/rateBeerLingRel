Very easy to drink and goes great with a steak.  It has been too long since a new Irish beer has hit the US market. It is about time.  It is also good to see a very honest brew amongst all the craft beers out there that rely on special adjuncts to mask their flavor. ,27.928,beerbaron357,Northern Ireland,4.8%,Strangford Lough Legbiter
