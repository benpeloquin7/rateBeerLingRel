Smells distinctly of spicy hops, a classic compliment to rye, but the rye malt itself comes through well. Some bready yeastiness is present and theres a verdant, fragrant character to the aroma as well. The flavor is wild. Rich with rye, backed up with hop spices, sweet yet uncompromisingly  bitter. Some deep roasted malts come through alongisde a sublte nuttiness. Would be excellent did this beer not have an explosive amount of carbontion. Every sip bombards the mouth with foam.
