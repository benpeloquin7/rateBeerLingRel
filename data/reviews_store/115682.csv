Dissolves quickly but leaves tremendous lacing

Smell is of rich chocolate, bourbon and slight hint of coffee. Wonderful.

Taste is very creamy. Nice chocolate flavor. Nice toasted coconut flavor and very slight bourbon, oak wood flavor on the back end.

 Thick but not too thick. Perfectly carbonated.

 Dangerously drinkable. Poured a couple while I was at Duckworths. Couldnt get enough of it. The alcohol is very well hidden even though its not a ""huge"" beer.

This is my favorite beer and cant wait til its released again at the end of the year. IF you havent tried this beer, do whatever you can to try it. Its worth the hype and some.  ",99.788,gehenherzog,North Carolina,8.5%,Olde Hickory The Event Horizon
