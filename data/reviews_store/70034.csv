Enjoyed it at the brewery and took 2 growlers to go.  I really enjoyed this beer and just wish I could buy bottles in the area.  Good flavor with a great finish, it didnt have the overly hopped bitterness that you might expect with that high of an alcohol content. ",90.107,JNS,Indiana,10.7%,New Albanian Hoptimus
