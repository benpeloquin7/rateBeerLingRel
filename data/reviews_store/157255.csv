Seems like a low score, but this is probably a beer worth drinking, particularly if you are just getting into Belgians. As a self-described quad snob, I would say this beer lacks the flavor and complexity that Ive come to expect from this style. Im looking for warm stone fruit flavors here and it just does not deliver on that front. Is it drinkable? Sure. Does it smell nice? Like Belgian candi sugar and alcohol. You get a little more of the fruitiness if you let it breathe for a bit. Will it get you feeling nice and tight? Ya man, if thats what youre looking for! But it just doesnt have that big flavor! Im waiting for Hardywood to really pull out all of the stops because they really are a genius business and I want them to succeed maybe more than any other RVA venture, but I need large flavors. Dial it up a bit, dont be scared! This beer will taste pretty good and it will satisfy you, but it wont blow your mind.  ",,philoceraptor,Virginia,9.5%,Hardywood Quad
