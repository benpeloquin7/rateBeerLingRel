Purchased at Whole Foods in Reno, NV. Great aroma, heady, musky. No head of foam when poured into pint glass, but impressive carbonation. Vigorous. Color of golden straw and was attractive. Initial taste caught me off guard. Not what I was expecting. Dry as expected, but the flavors of the cider went from complex to sour and the funk in the finish left me not actually wanting a second drink. I had heard good things about this cidery and was excited to find one of their offerings. I will try them again and I hope I just got a bad/old bottle ",58.905,Pgweir,England,6.5%,Ross On Wye Farmhouse Cider
