Its got a beautiful herb and pine smell. Depending on the bottle the citrus notes come out.  A perfect mix with the grass hops.  

Its not too light or too bold.  Its not oily.  Leaves a pleasant aftertaste of grapefruit (but not in the fruity way).   Its lively in the mouth but not overbearing.  Quite refreshing.  
It stimulates the taste buds just enough.  You dont want to eat or drink anything else with this as it  would be a shame to spoil the taste.  

Really great for daily drinking as its alcohol rate is lower and you can still keep your wits about you.  Thats why its a Session Ale.  Youre meant to be able to drink more over longer periods.  

LOVE THIS IPA.
