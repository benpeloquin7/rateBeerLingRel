Very sweet. So much citrus. Goes down smoothly. It has so much more balance than other IPAs. Im also glad they didnt just make a stronger Furious. This is a completely different beer. Its the perfect DIPA in my opinion.  ,99.841,ratebeej,Minnesota,9%,Surly Abrasive Ale

Ive had a lot of torpedo and this is a good change up that is perfect for the season. Pours a great red-orange color. Same palate as torpedo with about the same amount of alcohol.

I could definitely taste the bourbon aging and it is absolutely delicious. Overall the beer is kind of sweet. Best porter I have had although I havent had too many porters.
