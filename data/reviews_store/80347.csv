overall impression:
its important not to pigeon hole IPAs, but this honestly (OBJECTIVELY) wasnt my favorite beer. it seemed to have all of the bitter and negative qualities of an IPA without all of the wonderfully robust flavors and ""kick you ass"" kick. Looks BEAUTIFUL, but that doesnt carry weight if it doesnt taste good. 

I wouldnt pay to drink this again.  ",38.383,Kaga,Washington,6.5%,Redhook Long Hammer IPA

Brown with a off-white head. Personally I prefer them to appear a bit more bold at this level - but that doesnt necessarily mean anything. Very strange sediment. Taste is nutty with cloves and spices. Creamy finish.


Overall a great beer - VERY original and holds its own in a very high league.
