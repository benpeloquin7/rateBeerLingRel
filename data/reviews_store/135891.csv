I was given a couple of these to try and really had to choke them back. Its not bad as in major worldwide brewers buck a beer bad, but rather a total failure at what it attempts to achieve. There is nothing remotely comparable to any german beer Ive ever tasted, and it isnt a pilsner either. 

The first warning is that it says its german ""style"". Then you open the bottle and smell a yeasty, sour and slightly malty liquid. It tastes worse than it smells. Every individual flavour within this beer conflicts with every other flavour. Normally I prefer a crisp pilsner, or a complex ipa, or maybe a thick belgian abbey beer. At the time when I was drinking this, it was all the alcohol in the house. It was that or nothing. Every swallow resulted in a choke. I thought I had a bad batch due to the skunky flavour, but my experience seems to correlate with a few others. 

Ratebeer.com rates old english as the very worst beer in the world. I would drink a case of oe before I would subject myself to wolfgangs again. Please leave my beer store shelves alone and make some room for more duggans or flying monkeys, or sergeant major please. ",9.765,ocbguy,Canada,5.9%,Skeena Brewing Wolfgangs German Style
