Calendula and a hint of caramel.  
Dark Caramel-brown colour. Big white heavy head that lasts LONG.

Hoppy taste with really nice bitterness. Can taste a bit too sweet when temperated. Good citrus flavour and palate. 

Smooth and light, but still a holding aftertaste that fits the overall impression good.

One of the very best Norwegian pale ales. I prefer it served a bit colder than recommended temp .... about 10-12 celcius. ",93.971,JKJK,Norway,6%,Ngne  Pale Ale

Light coloured, nothing to add to appearance for a lager being. (not more or less). Light foam that dissappear quickly. Good taste that quickly changes to a bitter aftertaste that carry the very revealing alcohol aroma/palate.

Can be a bit ""tricky"", because it doesnt give away its relativly high alcohol precent right away, so you might feel like downing it. But at a bit cooler than room temperature, it gives avay its real self; with LOTS of alcohol taste/aroma, and its NOT good.

Downing a couple of theese ice cold would definately get the party started. But I dont concider it a good beer at all. ",9.479,JKJK,Poland,7%,Debowe Mocne
