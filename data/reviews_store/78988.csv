Nice frothy head, the first sip was clean and, well, ""raspberry-y"". The fruitiness wore off as the glass emptied, distinguishing this ale from the Belgian lambics Im better acquainted with. I very much enjoyed the subtlety of the raspberries here: more of a guest-star rather than the main attraction. Good balance of hoppy and malty with a pretty terrific finish. Went great with my gourmet burger. A unique, refreshing summer ale. Id order this again, with or without a meal. ",31.588,funkdragon23,Michigan,4.5%,Dark Horse Raspberry Ale
