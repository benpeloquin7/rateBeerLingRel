However Frank Naish and Paul Chant both help each other to make each others cider up every year from only 100% cider apples from there own orchards, some of the varietys are very ancient and some are there own sort grown from pit in the last 100 years or so.

There cider dont go below 7.5% but it usually is much higher somewhere between 8 and 9%, two years ago the first two barrels where exceeding 10.5%!! Opus? lol..

I must confess I would and have been extremely bias in my Rating, as I actually make ""Badgers Spit"" lol..

Being an Artisan Natural Cider every barrel is slightly different and the cider being a living product is changing throughout the year, its never the same ... Enjoy (=*_^=)
