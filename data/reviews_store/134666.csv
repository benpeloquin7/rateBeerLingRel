The initial aroma is of aluminium foil and the taste on the front palate confirms it. A truly horrific beer.

In a good way. This beer is no different.  Having tasted and enjoyed their Pot Kettle Black Dark IPA, I was looking forward to this beer. Yeastie Boys are known for pushing the boundaries of brewing and this beer is no different. The nose is exactly what youd expect. Smoke and tobacco. Its almost overpowering. I say almost because theres still something enjoyable about it. Its like being forced face first into an ashtray by an angry punter who thinks youve been eyeing of his missus but when he realises you stare that way because you have a bung eye, he decides to buy you a beer and shakes your hand. Colour wise, it has a brilliant golden hue. This is the main source of confusion. I generally associate the smoky hobo-ashtray like aromas with dark, sullen ales or porters but in this case it comes from a fantastic and bright looking beer. If I was to ever be tongue pashed by a chain smoking super model, this is what it would be like. Its terribly smoky but the hops comes through and leaves a nice spicy flavour with a lingering finish that reminds me of barbeque lamb chops. This is a mans beer. If you are a man and you dont like this beer then frankly, you are NO man in my books. A truly unique beer.

A Sauvignon Blanc in beer form. Thats what this actually smells and tastes like. Stereotypical NZ sauv blanc flavours; strong citrus with passionfruit, lychees and gooseberries. But then the hops kicks in and smashes the fucking door down like a drunken and horny gatecrasher at an all girls school function. Tables are getting flipped over and people are screaming and running for the door. This is a great beer. Probably the best IPA out of the 5 I have tasted. Burnt orange with a small head, it has a strong front palate with citrus flavours but then that gives way to a smooth and dry lingering finish. A delicious floral beer with a punch in the face. Like getting beaten up by a bridesmaid after you got drunk at a wedding and tried to get some poon-tang and had no idea your advances werent warranted. Fantastic.

If this is a true statement then I shall probably try and drink their whole catalogue. This is their double hop IPA and in true form it packs a bit of a punch. It has a lovely amber colour in the glass with a delicious, fluffy head. On the nose you get caramel and honey with some spice. It almost smells like mead. Up front it is all hops and nutty malts with a lingering, bitter finish. Im finding it a little sweet actually and the more it warms up the sweeter it gets. I wish I had left it in the fridge a bit longer to really get cold. It isnt disappointing and is probably the best Aussie IPA Ive had so far.

He told me it was a fantastic beer and he isnt one to bandy around such compliments. Unless he is drunk, which he was. Horrifically so. Still, I cracked this beer expecting perfection and boy, I wasnt disappointed. An American style IPA, its big on the hoppity hops. Yes sir. It is a cloudy gold in colour with a head like a fluffy cloud made of awesome. The nose is all floral, citrus and unicorn musk. My first sip turned into a gulp. This is a beer I could drink a lot of.  Its smooth and fresh and chock full of hops. The hops doesnt dominate though. It sort of sits there in the background like a surly bouncer who has his eye on you because you are flagrantly disregarding the dress code by wearing a hat. He hasnt made a move because the CCTV cameras are rolling but as soon as you go to the toilet, hell belt you one. Theres a melon flavour on the front palate with a delicious mild bitter finish. A very refreshing beer. A beer I could easily guzzle litres of on one of those hot days when your gooch is clammy and yearning for relief. ",97.592,Lazlo_Panaflex,Australia,5.8%,Feral Hop Hog
