The maltiness iS spot on and iS carbonated well. The head iS small and the color when poured iS a nice red hue. The aroma iS mellow and sweet pretty much like the brew itself.

I dont know what I was expecting from this. Maybe something like the other Barley Wine I tried. It was not like it at all. It was better......way better. This is a highly drinkable brew. Very smooth on all fronts. Well balanced and time was taken to craft this. I couldnt tell by the packaging the ABV% but its smoothness led me to believe it was around 7-8% when its 10.5%.....definitely unexpected. Its either that or I dont know the rule to Barley Wines. A great brown/red depending light angle.....also a strong hint of barley and malts with some fruit? Hops are non-existent in flavor but present in effect...I think. The head is light brown to tan/white and medium. Pretty bubbly and thick. Very nice on all edges and beats the other Barley Wine (ale style) on my list hands down! A great trick to pull on someone who likes a certain %ABV by prejudice and not taste as the % is not labled anywhere on box or bottle label so maybe this is the brew to get others to like the micros.

There is a bit of tartness but not bitter and follows to a clean finish begging for aother sip. The head is white and semi-thick (translucent) and pours a gorgeous golden-orange. The inital taste is that of bitterness then finishes cleanly with a bit of palate coating citrus. In my eyes a good finish. My brothers analysis of this was a bitter aroma in which he could smell the hops with a flavor of grapefruit but not overwhelming. One he said he would not go out and order specifically but definately drink if the bar was open so to speak. My sister-in law said the aroma was that of peaches....where my brother and I wer like ""okay where did that come from?"" It did not fit a girls taste as much as ours. This is a near perfect beer yet again raising my hopes for DarkLord day. If you want a palate clenser or complexifier try drinking a bit of 100% ruby red grapefruit juice with it. It WILL change the flavor dramatically. I know because I am on number 2 and wanted to experiment. This is not the most extreme brew I have been able to drink ABV% wise but overall a fine brew. $10 per 22oz will however keep me from buying mass quantities.----Overall concensentuious is a drinkable brew in which my brother could actually finish...as could I.

First off the aroma: A medium-powerfull but still not overwhelming aroma with a touch of fruit and sourness. It pours a thick medium to bright orange and thick meaning cloudy; you cant see through this one but it does glow a nice color with light behind + a slight head. The taste for the ABV% is; if I may make a comparison a far cry better than ""Camo Black Ice"" a FAR cry better. The alcohol is well hidden but by a bitter-sweet and back to bitter but not bitter meaning nasty flavor and is complex. In mouth its thick but not overly thick and a little syrupy but still not overdone. They seem to have taken their time developing this recipe in which I say thanks for showing that not all 10%ABV and above tastes not very good but its still not the best flavor wise...it is however my first Barley Wine and this may have something to do with it as Im usually an Ale fan weather its an IPA or not (which is why I picked up this Barley Wine Ale Style), a lager, and porter fan. For experimenting out of the box so to speak its not bad into itself but against others is where you get my rating. The finish is very smooth almost a 10 second linger then absolutely nothing, and no I cant place what is in here at all; its pretty complex and possibly not meant to be totally de-ciphered. This is a very crafty brew. This is a first impression rating. To those of you at Weyerbacher you are now my benchmark for Barley Wines....can anyone top you? Well find out but I also am not bias; never have been never will be...must keep an open mind and palate. Cheers to getting more both when I can and want it to effect me in a hurry!

The aroma is very mild; very. However when caught has a sour note to it. It pours into a glass a medium-dark golden orange with a good amount of head; almost none. The flavor is also mild but in a very good way. The taste is malty and crisp. The in mouth feel is more medium than heavy or light The finish is very smooth and lingering which is another good quality of it. Super slight chocolate undertones to balance the maltiness. Overall a super brew once again raising my hopes for DarkLord day. My palate accepts this brew with the full conviction of my rating but consider me as the X factor as I may have a slightly different taste for brews. 3Floyds has it going good! Also Im trying some right now but that is not the sole reason for this seemingly high score from me. It just fits my tastes. ,96.592,KiDAcE,Indiana,6.5%,Three Floyds Robert The Bruce Scottish Ale

The aroma was that of chocolate and hinted at the cream. I must agree that the chocolate malts are very present here. Its not thick or syrupy in fact it finishes well with the lingering of cream then chocolate-cream mix.

The aroma was that of sweet caramel. The flavor though wasnt what I was expecting since I had OLH first. Like OLH and its strong chocolate flavor this one lacked the strong caramel flavor.

The aroma was that of citrus and very slight hop hint. I was maybe expecting it to be the other way around. The taste caught me unexpectedly also I was expecting to actually taste the hops but the hide it well with the grapefruit and other citrus notes extremely well. Almost no sweetness to it from the hops. A powerfull bitter taste that in the mouth is very smooth and finishes cleanly overall with a lingering hint of citrus.
