Smoke is apparent in the aroma, as well as dried fruit, and when swirled in the glass, a slight presence of piney, resinous American hops.  The mouthfeel is right on, plenty of body without being   too thick.  The flavor is complex, with chocolate, roasted, fruity and smoky flavors all playing at once.  The beer comes on sweet and smoky at first, then finishes with a nice dark malt bitterness in the end.  Very nice. ",97.702,mtnbrwr,Idaho,8%,Grand Teton Black Cauldron Imperial Stout

The beer is slightly darker than it used to be, pouring a nice copper/light amber.  Seems like a bit more caramel malt may have been added.  The hop nose is more apparent, too.  The aroma is typical of an American style  pale made in the pacific NW.  Lots of  grapefruit and citrus dominate, maybe a slight lemon zest, too.  The malt provides enough backbone for the hops, without getting in their way.  Fairly bitter, but not over the top like a lot of modern American IPAs.  Yep, could drink a few of these.  Me likey.

When I first tasted it, it was much darker, too roasty and not what you think of when you think of an Amber ale.  Today it pours a deep amber, almost red color.  It has a fine, light tan head that rouses easily.  The aroma is balanced, nothing over the top, with some subtle, earthy hop aroma and caramel malt rising when swirled.  The flavor is well balanced, not too hoppy, not too malty.  I could drink a few of these, and probably will.  Overall, this is a very nice beer--highly drinkable without sacrificing flavor or mouthfeel.  Good Job! ",48.244,mtnbrwr,Idaho,4.7%,Grand Teton Amber Ale

They must have designed the label before they designed the beer, because this is not an ESB, unless you mean Extra Special Brown.  Pours a rich mahogany with a dense, tan head.  The foam remains for the duration of the pint.  Well balanced hints of chocolate and caramel malt meld beautifully with American high alpha hops.  Full bodied and full flavored, this is probably not a session beer; but brewed in a place where its winter most of the year, it hits the spot.
