It is now a Gold-Blonde Tripel, 33cl, 8.5. As I am a Abbey Tripel lover, this is one of the better ive tasted. It looks great in his new glass, with a nice white head with very fine bubbles. Aroma is like Abbey tripels have to be : Sweet,soft,Yeastly.
Flavor is a perfect merriage between bitterness end sweetness ( not sweet ! ). Really nice to drink and softly body ! Now the aroma, after a few zips, is great and strong, its a fine mate for bettre moments of life ! ",58.185,djar2003,Belgium,8.5%,Fisser Ne Flierefluiter Westelse Tripel
