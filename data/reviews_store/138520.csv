 I have allowed each bottle to approach their Best By date.
Three out of four of these experiences have been so over-carbonated as to generate a litre jug full of foam from just a quarter of the bottle, despite being served (unshaken!) at about 12 deg Celsius.
In the mouth it remains fizzy, volatile and virtually undrinkable because it continues to froth down to your stomach. maybe I have been unlucky. Three times in two years. Never again
Not recommendxed.
