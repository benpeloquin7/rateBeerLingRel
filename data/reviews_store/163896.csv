Appears bright golden but cloudy with a pillowy head that is reluctant to recede.
Tastes of mostly just dry bitterness and second to that some citrus. The ""white"" of this ipa is not very apparent in the taste.
Overall, this would just be a great example of what session ipas should be. Flavorful, dry, bitter, and in this case it does have the fuller body implied in the wit/ipa combo.  ",73.572,ShutItWoman,Wisconsin,6.5%,Capital Ghost Ship White IPA
