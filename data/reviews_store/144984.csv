I still have 20 bottles that have been properly stored (Closed case, stored in a cool basement.). Virtually no sediment in any bottle. Still carbonated. I only rated this beer to get my comment posted so you could have the vintage date. However, Lakefront continued to make this beer after I left in mid 98, and according to employees was made with a modified recipe, so you may have a different vintage. The original recipe had a 5 hour boil to reduce the volume by nearly 50% of the sweet liquor collected from the sparge.  All I know is that the vintage I have is still a tremendous brew according to those I have gifted recently. (im sober now.)
