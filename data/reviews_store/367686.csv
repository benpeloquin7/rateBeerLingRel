I used to think this was good WTF?I said to myself after the first sip. Its gross to me now and Im proud to be able to say that......like really fucking gross. Its kinda like drinking kool-aid without enough sugar in it. Very bland and leaves you wanting something with wayyy more substance. ,0.736,Tanner1984,Mexico,4.6%,Corona Extra
