I liked that it was in a four-pack seeing how it was an 8% brew. 
Color: golden amber with a generous white head. Nose: very aromatic with hints of orange, pineapple and passionfruit . Taste: a zest of grapefruit and orange with a slight bitterness and a warm tropical fruit finish. Although the IBUs are somewhat low for an imperial style (70ish), I really like this beer and the effort put forth by Widmer. Some imperial IPAs (especially in the Northwest) tend to be too over-the-top, this beer displays some great flavor characteristics without being drenched in hop bitterness.
