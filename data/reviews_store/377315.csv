Locals seem obsessed with this desperately average ale. When working in a pub local to the Wye Valley, complaints went up if this was not available on tap, Its actually funny! Pours light brown golden with slight fizz, overpowering caramel flavours with off-bread notes. Light body with oily texture and a soft carbonation. Overall ""little friend"" (in English) is anything but, and Wye Valley offer so many better ales in my opinion. ",25.856,ashleywakeling,England,4.5%,Wye Valley Butty Bach
