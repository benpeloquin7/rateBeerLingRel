Being a native myself, I love what these guys are doing. This is a Pale Ale that deserves attention! Tricks you with tastes like a west coast IPA with its big hit of pine and settles nicely with its pale ale mode of operation. IPA lovers/hop heads like myself will be more than satisfied, and then some. Skip the aroma... Not much of a frothy head but when it hits the palate, you can&apos;t help but say ""wooooow."" It&apos;s a big piney hit that ends with that typical citrus smack. Medium body and great beer all around. Can&apos;t get enough! Will NOT dissapoint

So my rating is a bit biased. Love everything about it. Rich copper in color. Aromas of deep, Rye malts. Taste is a quick hit of Rye with pretty big citrusy hops, 48 IBUs.

First tastes were very nutty and grassy; tasted almonds. Good malts, caramel was strong. Although they advertised it to be for a hop head, id say it&apos;s more PG13 on the hops. Good beer none the less. Not memorable but very drinkable

BOOM! HOPS! At 85 IBUs you either have a make it or break it hoppy beer and these guys did it right! Great IPA. Everything you want. Grapefruit hits you hard initially with the big hoppy finish. Finishes smooth yet chewy. Poured it from the 16oz tallboy can. Definite must drink for the hophead out there.
