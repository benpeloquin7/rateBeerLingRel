Very odd. Seems to focus more on the plant itself, rather than the spices that complement it. Theyre there, but the raw pumpkin itself is center stage. Its very malty and sweet with intense pumpkin flavor, but the spices dont come out in a big way until the finish.
Id seen this one all over the place and had been meaning to give it a try. Its certainly something unusual; the malt and raw pumpkin flavors seem to give this beer a sort of dual nature- sweet and mellow, but bright and fruity. Its interesting beer, but Im not quite sure what to make of it.
