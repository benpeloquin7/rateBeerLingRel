Appearance: beautiful red to amber hue. Thick head which left plenty of webs. 

Taste: surprisingly easy to drink for an Imperial red. 

Palate: Sticky Mouthfeel with a head that was thick and delicious. 

Overall: I can see why this is such a favorite among beer drinkers. A great easy to drink robust beer. an instant favorite in my opinion.  ",98.727,dinopuncher,Colorado,8.7%,Oskar Blues GKnight Imperial Red

Appearance: Not much to write home about in terms of appearance dark with a good thick head that dissipates quickley

Taste: The front tast of the beer is citrusy from the hops the malt finish then tastes very much of hops. these two flavors do not combine well. 

Palate. The beer is a lot thinner then I expected slightly thicker than that of an iced coffee

Overall: A coffee infused beer is a great idea but would be better done with a stout or porter then a brown ale.  ",84.347,dinopuncher,Colorado,6%,New Belgium Giddy Up!

Very little of the hop aroma comes through although a great deal of the malts do offering a subtle carmel/roasty notes.

Apperance: The beer is brow but not opaque it pours with a good tan head

Taste. Despite being a Brown Ale this has a fairly light feel to it. Much of flavor comes from the malts which offer a Chocalatey/Malty flavor to it. 

Palate: The beer has a very smooth medium mouth feel. While not a sessionable beer it does drink very easily. 

Overall: My Favorite Brown Ale Ive tried so far. Although Im not a huge fan of the style I can see myself buying this beer plenty more times.  ",90.107,dinopuncher,Colorado,5.6%,New Belgium 1554 Enlightened Black Lager
