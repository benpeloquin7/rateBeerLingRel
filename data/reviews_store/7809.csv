I thought the 2000 and 2001 editions were excellent while the 2002 was just good.  Every year the beer has a complex flavor that brings out the best in the featured hop.
The beer comes out early each fall.  DO NOT BUY THIS BEER AFTER THANKSGIVING.
The 2002 edition had a nice mix of Vanguard hop and chocolate flavors.  Still it was not up to the high standards set by earlier years.  ",84.8,MrBadExample,Maryland,5.5%,Blue Ridge (MD) Hopfest Brown Ale
