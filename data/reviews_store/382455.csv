Apperance: A typical light straw yellow
Aroma: Apples mixed with a faint hint of earthiness 
Taste: Suprisingly complex, a small sweetness of apples followed by notes of bitter pine and rosemary. Finishes slightly dry. Really an amazing flavor experience but is very drinkable and sessionable at the same time. Very refreshing.
Palate: Light on the tongue with near perfect carbonation, which allows the detailed flavor notes to be expressed more. 
Overall: I was very surprised by how good this cider was. Its a must try if you like cider that is inbetween the dry and super sweet category. Im not a cider fan per se, but its one of the best cider offerings Ive ever had. Most of Bold Rocks ciders are no frills, decent ciders, but this one is above and beyond the rest.
