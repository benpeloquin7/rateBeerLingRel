A head forms a half to three quarters of an inch high, white in color, staying there for sometime. The spicy, sweet, fragrances of the Belgian yeast is at the front of the aroma. That is followed by a mild grassy scent, along with a soft citrus fragrance. The yeasty esters are strong at the beginning of each taste. That is soon followed by hearty bread and mild malt flavors. Then at the halfway point across the palate, the growing flavor of grapefruit hits. Brought along for the ride are grassy and earthy flavors, which linger on the palate for sometime. A heavy watery feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it rolls to the back. It finishes with an arid dryness on the back of the palate. This is a strong Belgian IPA, bringing the unique flavors from the yeast and the added intensity of hops; make this a very worldly beer. I throw it at some spicy Mexican or Chinese dishes.

The beer is poured to medium amber in color, with hints of gold along the sides of the glass. A half inch high head forms on top, which is cream in color. There is a slight scent of cracked grain at the start. Then the strong aroma of citrus strikes the nose. That is followed by grass and pine fragrances at the end. The surprising flavor of bread is at the front of each taste, followed by a yeasty twang. It then blends itself to strong grapefruit bitterness, then ending with an earthy flavor. The feel is medium bodied, most of the way through. There is the slight feel of oiliness halfway, but does not deter the strong dry finish. This is beer is a hop heads go to beer, strong aroma, along with the big hoppy flavor; make this a beer for any occasion.

A strong grassy hop flavor lingers, long after each taste. A medium bodied feel, that gradually gains weight slightly, finishes with mild dryness.

The sweet smell of malt and chocolate, with the added aroma of charred wood, that also adds a vanilla scent. The hops are in there in the aroma, but seem to be over powered by the wood and alchol aromas. The flavor brings in the aromas on the palate with the hops being more prevalent in the taste. The oak wood flavor becomes stronger after every sip. In the mouth it feels a little thinner than the non aged Yeti, alot like skim milk, with some evidence of carbonation, but not alot. This is a drinkable beer, but drink slowly. The strong alchol, flavors and texture, make this a sipping beer by a nice warm fire.

Coffee and chocolate blended with scents of bourbon, lets just say I like it alot. The taste is just as impressive, the coffee and chocolate malt hit the palate, then the boubon comes in with caramel and vanilla flavors. In the mouth it is thick and syrupy, coating the palate, the leaving that warm feeling of in the back of the throat that bourbon has. This is a very impressive beer, drink slowly, these flavors are meant to be enjoyed gradually. It is nice to see a beer getting intense flavor from something other than hops, not that anything wrong with that.
