This was the highlight of the day.  I loved this stuff!  Basically imagine sitting at breakfast, having a nice full pancake meal, with maple syrup, sausage, and a little fruit bowl.  Take in that smell and that is this beer.  Flavor was chocolately and maple syruppy, but also smokey.  It was a beautiful cloudy dark brown color.  The mouthfeel was unbelievably smooth.  All I can say is wow!  I wonder if this is as good when its not on cask.   ",96.535,amorphiss,Pennsylvania,6.8%,Copper Crow Chocolate Thunder

This smells so nice.  Smells like cherries, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, bourbon.  No head or carbonation really, but is a really nice dark reddish brown - very clear.

Whats not to like about the appearance?  It looks like a beautiful dark imperial stout.  Aroma is really interesting.  Started with apple cinnamon, vanilla, caramel.  Later some fruityness and some musty notes.  Flavor is quite smooth, I was expecting it to be more bold, especially since its such a fresh bottle; well balanced.  It has lots of rich chocolatey-coffeeish notes, and I can definitely taste the black currants.  The mouthfeel has lots of structure, it is smooth and oily.  Overall this was quite nice.

This beer is awesome!  Very beautiful to look at.  Dark reddish/brownish body with a little bit of lasting foam on top.  Color looks a little bit like a very dark high quality maple syrup.  Aromas of vanilla, oak, bourbon, maybe a little bit of fruit.  Tastes also of bourbon, oak, sweet malts, brown sugar.  This beer starts sweet but finishes very bitter and acidic, which is really nice.  The bourbon is really prominent on this beer, but it works really well with the style.
