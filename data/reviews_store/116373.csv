Aroma is slightly nutty if you really search for it. Very thin body and not as roasty as I like my browns to be. I was expecting more from this beer. Not horrible, just nothing to write home about.

First time was a smaller sample and I didnt like at all. Pours a nice orange color with a small white head. Nice carbonation and mouth feel. I was surprised that this one was 6.3%, it drank a lot boozier. I was searching for the smoke that a lot of people mentioned, but I didnt get it at all. Maybe it has settled out a bit. Lots of dark fruit flavors and caramel malt sweetness. Couldnt find the plaintains or the carob at all. Overall a decent beer that I am glad I tried again, but wouldnt seek out for another.

Wow, I could not have been more disappointed. I know I am in the minority with this one, but this was a rare drain pour from me. Neither me nor the person I shared with could stomach this one at all. I am a big New Glarus fan and this one missed. Nice cherry nose, but the the taste to me was all cherry medicine. I may be being a bit generous with 8 out of 20 overall, but the nose was pretty good and the appearance was average.  ",98.513,AJDuhe,Wisconsin,6.5%,New Glarus Thumbprint Series Cherry Stout
