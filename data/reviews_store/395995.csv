Little aroma but a slight tartness (berry like). Creamy mouthfeel. Tartness is balanced with malt. Bitterness is in check. Flavor is almost strawberry. No alcohol bite at all.

Low head with nice clear Amber-copper color. Nice balance with malt/bitterness but hop aroma and flavor are less pronounced than I would like. May be aged a bit. Not bad but is probably not representative of what the beer tastes like fresh.
