But, to be clear, it is a ""malt liquor"" not a beer. Its competition is already week, but this stuff doesnt even lead the pack. Admittedly, I didnt realize it was a malt liquor when I bought it. It pours nicely, though it isnt great at holding a head. Nice deep gold color that makes you think there might be something for flavor there. Taste and aroma-wise it comes off like Steel Reserves cousin, almost identical. It starts off nice enough with a slight sweetness, but that doesnt last, it finishes with a typical malt liquor/old beer taste. Granted most of these beers taste the same... As far as drinkability goes, it has a bit too much carbonation, smooth enough, but needs just a little less. Miller needs to regulate the pressure down on their CO2 tanks a couple of psi. Sometimes I think the lesser quality stuff is carbonated more to irritate and fool your taste buds. This stuff would probably greatly benefit from some dry-hopping to balance out the incredible malt flavoring. ",7.462,justinh2,Wisconsin,6.9%,Miller Fortune
