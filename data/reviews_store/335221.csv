Ive gradually gravitated to this local offering as my favorite IPA. Not as extreme as the high end west coast stuff but much more balanced. Fluffy white head on the pour revealing beautiful amber color and moderate carbonation. Piney hops nose and taste comes through loud and clear on the front and the back side balanced by a nice malty backbone and creamy texture. Not a particularly complex beer, but in the end, thats what I like about it the most. Highly recommended! ",82.098,JamesMichael,New Mexico,6.6%,Santa Fe Happy Camper IPA

A decent take on a fall IPA I guess, but Ive had better. Impressive, lasting fluffy off-white head. Lots of peppery notes coming through for me. Very bitter hops finish. Nice body and lovely almost opaque reddish brown color. Typical SN quality, so definitely better than most, but I definitely prefer their Ruthless Rye and Torpedo IPAs.

Bready, doughy, earthy, roasted, and hearth-like. All things good and fall in a bottle. Question: Why doesnt SN offer this as a stand alone in 6s, 12s, and growlers? The Nut Brown and the Vienna Lager are ok I guess, but including their standard Pale Ale in a ""Seasonal"" collection like this is just plain a rip off.
