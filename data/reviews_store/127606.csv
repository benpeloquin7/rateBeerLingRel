Appearance- looks nice, not black... Dark brown with a tan rocky head.
Taste- offensive to my palate. Maybe this was infected or something. Phenolic, plasticy... These terrible off flavors cover up anything that may be good underneath.
Palate- lacking in body and way over carbonated. Slightly astringent.
Overall- I can hardly believe that this is a commercial beer. When I saw the score of 90, I was floored. This beer is a drain pour. The only reason why I drank half of it was for these tasting notes.
