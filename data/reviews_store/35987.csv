Let me start by saying that I fine the brews from Dogfish Head to be truly solid if not excellent.  I love the fact that they are willing to be daring in their attempts.  I have not rated in a while which is a shame because I have been busy trying quite a few beers.  It just got the to point that rating was taking too much time.  Anyways here goes.
Aroma: Not as hoppy as I expected but it is present with a undercurrent of honey and the apricots.
Appearance: Clear, bright orange with a smallish lingering head.
Flavor: Here is where you get the hops.  It is bitter and dry and just underneath it you can taste the sweet fruitiness of the apricots.
Palate:  The bitterness lingers on your tongue for an exceptional amount of time.  Finishes somewhat dry but not overly so.
Overall: I could see drinking a lot of this beer and never knowing that apricots were part of the recipe.  It is quite tasty and enjoyable if you like a good bitter IPA, which I certainly do.  Another fine offering from Dogfish Head. ",90.031,BeerCommonSewr,Delaware,7%,Dogfish Head ApriHop

I see that my rating for this beer is skewed from the rest being given to it.  Let me start by saying that this was a nice package with a ceramic looking bottle and cork.  Normally something I would even give a point or two.  However it was clear that this particular did not ship well as the cork was only maybe half an inch into the bottle and it appeared as if some leakage had occurred.  After opening the bottle and pouring it was also clear some type of mold or fungus had begun to grow along the rim of the bottle and I had to fish a large chunk of it out of the glass.  Given all this I am not one to give up on a bottle that I paid decent money for.  There was practically no head and the beer was somewhat flat further proving to me that some leakage had taken place.  The only real flavor I can say came through is malt, malt, and more malt finishing with a dusty dry taste.  The one saving grace for this brew was that once I was done I gotten a nice little buzz.  Of course that may have been from the fungus or mold but a buzz is a buzz nonethless.  Maybe some day I can give this beer another shot but I will wait for a fresh shipment and a close inspection of the bottle to see if it is worth my time.  I must say that I find this beers scores odd as I read other reviews as it does not seem as many people liked it very much.  Why the somewhat high rating then is a mystery to me.  Peobably the beer snobs giving it a higher rating than it deserves because it comes from Belgium. ",91.497,BeerCommonSewr,Belgium,8.5%,Delirium Nocturnum

Aroma: Sweet light malt and some vanilla.
Appearance: Amber in color with a nice off white head that sustained well.
Flavor: I did not read the deScription before I tasted it and even though the scent hinted at it I was quite surprised at the flavor.  At first I thought it was coriander I was tasting but after going back and getting the bottle I realized it was probably the vanilla and bourbon oak melding into this taste.  Even though it does not feel right as I feel there must some other spice added that is just difficult to identify.  Perhaps it is coriander or ginger.  I am simply unsure.  It was sweet but not unpleasantly so.  I also did not know when I first tasted it that it was an A-B product.
Palate: Very smooth and sweet.  Not as full bodied as I had expected in a bourbon cask ale.
Overall:  Beer snobs that we are we must begin to look past the brewer and the label.  This beer should be rated higher than it is.  I enjoyed it.  Even if it was sweet and medium bodied.  It was different but not unpleasant.  I grew up near Milwaukee but even though I cannot say I am a fan of Miller I have a fair amount of disdain for Anhueser-Busch.  Growing up where I did however gave me my appreciation for beer in general.  All that being said I would drink this beer again as it provides a nice change of pace your normal rotation.

Aroma: Bitter chocolate, some sweet and malts.
Appearance: Mahogany with an off white head that did not sustain well long after the pour.
Flavor: Dark chocolate flavor.  Like dark chocolate it is bitter with some sweetness.  It was somewhat thin but interesting.  There were also some coffee and roasted malts flavors as well.
Palate:  Was bittersweet and dry which was to be expected with an 8.5% alcohol content.
Overall:  I see that I am giving this one of the highest ratings on the board so far.  I honestly think if you did not tell people this was from Michelob and just made them rate it based on its merits it would receive a higher rating in general.  Yes, we are all beer snobs.  Nonetheless this offering was quite potent.  Maybe hitting too many over the head with the dark chocolate.  It is certainly not subtle and it could be better balanced with a stonger hops offering.  Nonetheless I did enjoy this beer for what it was advertsied to be which was a chocolate beer.  It was certainly that.

P.S.- The bottle that this and the Vanilla Oak came in are unique in that they have a bullet shape.  After opening however you find it is just a plastic top covering a metal screw off cap like you would find on a 40 oz. malt liquor.  A cork here would have been much more appropriate.  Therefore the appearance score was deducted a point when it was more than possible it could have been a postive feature instead of a drawback.

Flavor: Starts sweet with the orange peel evident and ends almost sour with the coriander coming through.
Palate: Thin mouthfeel with that corander sour taste lingering.
Overall: I did not love this beer by any stretch but I cannot say it was not worth trying.  If by the artwork on the label they are implying this is Mothers Milk than mother needs to go into a treatment program because her milk was awfully sour. ",45.73,BeerCommonSewr,Belgium,5%,Vuuve

They used the black licorice to alter the taste towards root beer but the molasses was not quite sweet enough in the initial taste to get it there.  Weird.

Overall-I could having a session with this beer.  Especially if I am with a group of people that are used to mass market brew.  Its OK but far from special. ",23.079,BeerCommonSewr,New York,5.1%,Saranac Golden Pilsener

Matt Brewing Company,10, North Carolina,2,131,Fruit Beer,http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/saranac-mountain-berry-ale/13556/35987/,"12 oz. bottle from Beers of Summer collection  Note: Label is brown not red and BERRY is not in the name.  However, based on the deScription this is the same beer.
Aroma: Sweet and malty with a hint of berry
Appearance:Slightly reddish amber brown.  Head again is a major disappointment as usual with the Saranac offerering.  Just does not sustain and is weak from the get go.
Flavor: This is the best of the 6 beers from Saranac I have tasted.  Unfortunately that is just not saying very much.  It is rather thin but it does have a nice sweetness to it that I liked.
Palate: Finishes fairly quickly and clean.
Overall: As stated this is the best of the Saranac beers sampled.  Clearly a company too focused on trying to appeal to the masses instead of working on staying true to the style that they are attempting to produce.  Of all of their beers though I could actually see drinking a few of these. ",24.183,BeerCommonSewr,New York,5%,Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale

Aroma-Yeasty with a touch of coriander.
Appearance-Looked like a hazy orange soda.  Head was disappointing large bubbles with very little sustainment and virtually no lacing.  This is one of the most common knocks I have on Saranac beers.
Flavor-Some wheat and coriander but overall weak in overall taste for a white.
Palate-Finishes quickly and slightly dry.
Overall-An OK beer at best but nothing special.  I am quickly coming to the conslusion that Saranac is a small beer company with a big beer mentality.  In other words, by attempting to appeal to the masses they have made a range of beers that is overall rather boring and tend to taste a lot alike regardless of style.

Aroma: Sweet orange peel scent with only a hint of hops.  Smelled somewhat like an orange popscicle.
Appearance: Hazy orange, like Tang.  Thin around the edges.  Virtually no head to speak of which was disappointing.
Flavor: Wheat and lots of spice overpowered by mushroomy,  chalky, and dusty flavors.
Palate: Dry somewhat metallic finish with some licorice
Overall: I was tremendously disappointed with this beer as I was looking to Averys version of a Golden Belgian Ale.  Perhaps the travel and the storage of this beer altered its flavors and it just did not age well in the bottle.  I cannot imagine this being a popular choice if this is its regular flavor.  Reading other reviews I have to believe it is not. ",93.589,BeerCommonSewr,Colorado,9%,Avery Salvation

Aroma: Dark malts with sweet red fruits.
Appearance: Nice, clear deep reddish amber.  Head was minimal however.
Flavor: Unique.  Sweet and malty.  The raisin taste was noticeable.
Palate: Finish began sweet and ended up dry red wine.  Mouthfeel was medium heavy.
Overall: Very interesting beer and yet I cannot rate it as highly as some of the other raters here as I just did not really love the flavor even though I can appreciate it.  Worth checking out regardless.  This company definitely makes some quality brews. ",94.716,BeerCommonSewr,Delaware,8%,Dogfish Head Raison D Etre

Aroma: Yeasty and wheaty odor wih a hint of citrus.  You definitely knew you were going to be drinking a White beer with this scent.
Appearance: Hazy straw orange in color.  Not as much sedimenation as I expected with the pouring instructions on the label but that was fine.  Head was frothy and rocky white bubbles with some lacing that sustained nicely.
Flavor: Yeasty and wheaty like the odor suggested with the orange peel coming through at the end.  The coriander was very subtly  noted which blended together gave it a bit of a bubble gum taste.
Palate: Thin mouthfeel that did not linger overly long but the different flavors coming through after swallowing was pleasant.
Overall: Quality beer again from Allagash which is a brewery I am growing more fond of with each sampling. ",91.426,BeerCommonSewr,Maine,5%,Allagash White
