This is my second, bt it was below 0 drinking barely above 0 beer.  Not good for reviews.

Medium sized head, nice off white.  Doesnt lace much though.
Nice gold colour, very slear and low carbonation.
Clove, allspice, ginger and cookie smell, and all that again in the taste.  
Medium body, taste lasts a fair time, with a sweet spicy last.

Not much smell at all, until I had a first sip, then toffee, nuts and bread.
Alcohol and tobacco at first, and pepper and honey after.

I have had this bottle in my cellar since ast December.

Medium light brown head, lasts a long time as does the lacing.
Heavy peat, molasses and perfume smell, right from opening the bottle.
Medium body, medium carbonation with an astringent finish.
Average lasting flavour of some port, wood, peat and scotch.
