Smooth amber coloured ale with a nice maltiness and hints of caramel and honey. Rather mild and I think Id prefer with with food rather than on its own, cause its not that packed with flavour to stand on its own. The hops almost add an earthy touch to it.

Almost black with brownish foam that didnt stay that long. First sip was a vanilla explosion in my mouth, but after a few sips the alcohol was a bit over powering. Hints of licorice and spirits. This beer had probably earned on being a few % less strong. The general flavour, however, was really good, but not excellent. ",98.94,TzR,New York,10.4%,Evil Twin Soft Dookie

One of the best beers Ive ever had and I still have got one left that has rested for over a year now (bought 4 of them initially). I absolutely love the ""original"" Gonzo and the time it spent in the barrel just added a great dimension to it. Nice dark colour with thick white foam. Lovely sweet flavour with hints of chocolate and an awsome oak finish.  ",99.1,TzR,Maryland,9.5%,Flying Dog Wild Dog Barrel-Aged Gonzo

Traded this at my local pub for one of my home home brewn IPA:s. And what an excellent trade it was. Nice black colour and brown foam.  Smells like fruit and chocolate and the taste is fenomenal with the cranberry adding a lot to it with a slight after taste of oak. A very nice beer that lasts long. ,98.405,TzR,Scotland,18.2%,BrewDog Tokyo*
