Metallic, light beer tasting with absolutely no body. Gotta be fortified, anything lacking this much body has to be fortified, which leads to another problem - expect a very raw and angry drunk from this poison. 211 is one digit from the number that will be called on you later on: 911. If you can drink 3 or more of these and not be tazored and/or arrested, your 3rd can was probably not a 211, but a Tilt.  ",0.294,mdinseattle,Wisconsin,8.1%,Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity

Hurricane stands alone among the 8.1% alcohol beers, as it clobbers the thick - never -seeming -cold enough Old English HG, and smoothly beats  the sure fire 911 call that accompanies 211 Steel Reserve.
Anheuser Busch again proves why they are the king of beers.
