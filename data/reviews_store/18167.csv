Instead we get nasty Fosters and the Australian ex-pats and tourists laugh at how its trumped up to be a premium beer. A friend brought back a six pack for me. Drank it immediately with a neighbor on a summer day. All the postings seem to bash this beer but as a somewhat discerning beer drinker,  I thought it had a nice flavor, very pleasant. Wish we could get more of it here. ",2.353,CKCK,Australia,4.9%,Victoria Bitter

This is not a beer for beer snobs. Certainly America has come of age with beer - microbrews and the popularity of foreign beers. But...appreciate it for what it is - an old time classic thats making a bit of a comeback with the college set. Colder is better, draft bottles over cans. I have a pub close by that has it for $3.00 a 20 oz glass.   It has a decent flavor, very drinkable. Much more character than the generic beers from Budweiser.
