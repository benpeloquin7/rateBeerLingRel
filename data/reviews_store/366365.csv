Wow, after assaulting the nose, this beer grabs the tongue with two full hands of hops and then hangs on, long after the liquid has hit the gullet. Aroma clearly of tropical fruits and pine. Pineapple, mango, and piney. Golden to pale yellow. My beer was exceptionally frothy. Flavour was all upfront hops and then lingering bitterness. Then you realise it tastes just like grapefruit. Now dont let that put you off, as I dont like grapefruit, but his is amazing. It has all the tang and bitterness of a grapefruit, but somehow manages to still be nice. Its like there is a hint of another citrus fruit that just saves it from being too tart. So this beer is light on sweetness, big on bitterness with a finish on sour and a hint of salty at the end. 
Im a malt guy, but this is a Wow beer. Too big for larger lovers, but if you are after a hop hit - this is right up there.

Especially a lightly flavoured beer like a lager. Should be a criminal offence. Anyway - I remembered this much more fondly than I do now after tasting again. Simple lager with clean crisp finish when it hasnt gone off in the bottle. Too hit and miss and too simple to waste time on having again. Lawn mowing beer at best.  ,8.329,DavidAust,New Zealand,5%,Steinlager Classic

Clear yellow with small white head. Very weak aroma - might be a good thing. Fizzy carbonation. Sweet corn / grain taste - and not much else. Not particularly offensive. Not particularly anything.

Black with a foaming beige head. Soft aroma of toasted malts. Roasted malts upfront, medium carbonation to soften the impact and then something at the back - coffee? smoke? Not sure, but slightly bitter. Bitterness 
finishes fairly quickly and the malts reappear as they linger on the palate. Enjoyable mouthfeel - neither thin nor silky, just medium and right for the flavours. A good, highly drinkable beer - quite sessionable and the best of the style Ive had so far.  ",72.081,DavidAust,Germany,4.8%,Kstritzer Schwarzbier
