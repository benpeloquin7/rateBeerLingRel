The color is beautiful a medium amber with a hint of red thats very bright and well filtered.  An off-white head that dissipated quickly.  A mostly malt flavor with hints of biscuit and caramel with a medium-dry finish.  Almost no hop flavor up front and just a tinge of hop in the aftertaste.  A very well balanced amber.  This is a gentle beer.  But, according to BJCP style guidelines, ambers are light in aroma, low in bitterness and medium-light in body.  This amber fits the deScription. It could be a bit more carbonated. ",17.268,Garuda2,New Mexico,5.2%,Sierra Blanca Roswell Alien Amber Ale
