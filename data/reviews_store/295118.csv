Big frothy white head that retains well, slightly hazy golden colour ale. Great balance in tasting, no flavour dominates the palate nor lingers too long, nice and clean. Slightly too carbonated for my liking, but its not a deal breaker.

This is a great introduction to the world of Belgian beer, and is also readily available, youll find this in nearly every supermarket. A shining example that mass manufactured beer doesnt have to be of poor quality. ",98.244,Circos,Belgium,8.5%,Duvel

Bitter at first with a dry but pleasant after taste, the hops do not dominate the palate as the balance has been maintained rather well, bitterness subsides after a while, allowing you to fully appreciate the flavours.

Pours effortlessly into the glass with a small but present head (maintains well), smelling of rich malt with a deep and lasting sweetness. Slightly cloudy in the glass.

Never have I had the pleasure of tasting a beer with such impeccable balance as this, every mouthful was an absolute joy and consistently offered new flavours. A medium bodied, lively and somewhat creamy texture. The rather heavy carbonation of the beer really helps to make this beer quite playful.

Absolutely wonderful, cannot fault it. Its a testament to the skill of the brewers to be able to serve up a 9.2% alcohol beer and barely be able to notice it at all while drinking. Really superb, thoroughly recommend. ",99.841,Circos,Belgium,9.2%,Rochefort Trappistes 8

With the first few mouthfuls, the bitterness overwhelmed my palate leaving no room for any flavour whatsoever - consistently the beer lacked complexity with each mouthful and was even difficult to swallow at some points as the lack of carbonation in the beer intensified the bitterness.

An commendable attempt, but very bland and uninspiring. Wouldnt buy again.
