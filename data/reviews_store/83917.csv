The head is thin, white, and leaves minimal lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is balanced between citrus hoppiness and caramel malt - again a surprise, as I expected the hop aroma to be dominant.

The alcohol is barely present in the nose. The flavor follows the aroma with chocolate, coffee, cigar smoke, and a touch of bourbon in the finish.

The flavor is amazingly well balanced. The hops are prominent, of course, with an initial sweetness that is unexpected.

I received this beer as part of a 4-pack of Christmas-themed beers from Ridgeway. Because of the gimmicky nature of the package, my expectations werent high. Unfortunately, this beer couldnt even meet my low expectations. The beer touts itself as a brown ale, but was very pale - certainly not yellow, but a long way from having the robust color you might expect from a brown ale. The taste of the beer was also disappointing. There was nothing unique at all about this beer - it was thin, watery, and had no distinct flavors.
