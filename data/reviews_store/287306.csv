Unreal great non IPA but never the less it is an IPA in its purest sense. Unlike most IPAs that I shy away from this has a multy dimension of hops from aroma to mouthfeel to finish. Balanced IPA sounds strange but this s not you typical IPA that folks shove tons of Citra at you. Great great great!  ,95.672,Sourguy83,California,7.9%,Monkey Paw Bonobos IPA/SD Pale Ale
