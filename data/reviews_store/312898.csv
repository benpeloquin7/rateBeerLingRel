The taste is very citrusy because of the lime with a slight taste of tequila no real typical beer taste at all. Not exactly a beer more like a breezer maybe?

It isnt a beer which has a lot of taste it must be said but I find it refreshing.

I really enjoyed this beer, I thought it had quite a bit of flavour to it mostly from the coriander spicing which is also very apparent in the aroma. Its very fizzy at first which at first takes away from the taste until it has calmed down. It goes down easy and is very smooth and light overall I enjoyed it will definitely be having another bottle!  ",35.639,frightts,Colorado,5.4%,Blue Moon Belgian White Ale
