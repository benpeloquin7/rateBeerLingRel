Pale golden beer with a dissipating head. The beer is quite clear for its lack of filtration. Looks deceptively ordinary however.
But then, Witkaps secret reveals itself.. Under the white hood of this monk lies a delicate but completely surprising bouquet of flowers. Jasmin petals seem quite prominent - although they are just a figment of my imanigation caused by the general citrus fruitishness. You really have to take your nose into this journey.
Its a pity the taste doesnt really make all those promises true, and the beer tastes  a bit undecisive, the lingering sweetness acts like an annoying child ruining a perfect adult moment. Still, its a very drinkable ale with a long bitter and pepperish finish. Always fresh, like it was built from grass dew.

Breathes coffee and a dark peasants bread, alcohol. Going down, there are pieces of gingerbread, and then real deep in the nose theres a small surprise, a sweet thing, the sprout of a cinnamon and vanilla pair, but hard to get to.
Taste is no surprise, coffee again, and dough with wood. Oily texture, less creamy than some other abts. Makes me want to eat a cookie. My girl-friend says ""Bellewaerde!"" because it reminds her of an amusement park. I try to focus on dominant flavours but the beer lacks some identity. Perhaps this is why I like it so much, it doesnt try to be anything different.
Long finish with heavy alcohol and no further surprises, which is a bit disappointing and substracts some value. Will probably re-rate this as I become more experienced. ",99.894,MMortier,Belgium,10%,St. Bernardus Abt 12

The head lacing is really something unique, you can stare at it for hours and it doesnt disappear.Nose is complex, cold caramel in a deep pit of bananas, but no real nose-taste diff aside from the higher alcohol aroma.
The texture of this Trappist is very thick and creamy and makes the dominating flavours (rotten bananas, dough) last long enough to whithstand the high alcohol rate. This is something Bernardus and Westvleteren cant manage well - and it seems like each bottle of Westy rounds off differently.
However, some may feel that the taste is a bit artificial, too fruitish, too freakish, and prefer Westy or other Abts for their more earthily tastes.

Golden unfiltered beer, a lot of yeast swerves through the bottle, like silk hurricanes.
On to taste because I have a hard time remembering the nose.
The interplay between citrus and dryness is perfectly proportioned here.
Orval drinkers will recognize many subtleties there.
After a while the beer kind of balances itself between honey sweet - without the heaviness - and citrus spice - without the sourness. I find it hard to define but I am not an experienced rater yet. It is a very pleasant experience. I do like it better when the beer is cold (8 - 10C) and the tastes are a bit toned down.
And then it becomes dry and you have another sip just to be sure you didnt miss anything. The 75 ml bottle was gone before I realised it. This is one dangerous beer.
