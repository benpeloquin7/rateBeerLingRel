The nose had light malts with some nice sweet citrus on the nose. This translated well to the taste as there was nice malt with an acidic touch on the from tongue while there was a slight smoke finish with just a hint of sausage. Gotta admit I didnt pick that up on the nose.

This beer has good mouthfeel as is just a tad nit light for the style, making this a very easy beer to enjoy. I did however, get some cloying towards the end of my pint, but all and all a tasty.

The beer poured a medium amber, clear, minute head with slight carbonation.

The bouquet has quite a bit of caramel malt with back notes of grains. The caramel tones really overpowered the rest of the bouquet. The taste is initially caramel, but the finish is of dry grains and bready yeast.

The body is on the heavier side of medium, as the taste really takes over the old buds. The beer also cloys a bit, but this really does not detract from the drinking.

This is a tasty beer that is good cold, but really workd well under English conditions. I plan to have more of this during the summer!

This beer pours a deep brown, clear, very light carbonation and a light off white head.
(Pardon me while I have another)

The bouquet is of roasted chocolate malts, slight hops and I am getting a currant and black cherry tobacco finish. (Gotta run to the fridge and get another, Ill be right back)

The taste is spectacular and quite complex. Warming chocolate, malt, hops, deep fruits and a touch of hazelnuts. A slight alcohol bite. Everything I want in a dark beer. These tastes linger on the taste buds and slowly dissipate. (Crap, Im out, gotta run to see Capone)

The body is a bit bold, but I believe that only enhances that wonderful, warming mouthfeel. This is a great sipping beer, a great steak beer, a great fire place beer, aw hell, just a great beer! ",99.259,garcia2a,Delaware,12%,Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron
