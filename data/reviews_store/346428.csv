In citric flavor and fruity notes, damask, are sweeping the mouth overshadowing a bit sweet malt notes which emerges a powerful bitterness that is characteristic of American IPAs and that somehow does not presuppose the Abbey beers Belgians, however is certain duality does not leave us to take another notion of this peculiar Tripel high lupalagem and certain acidity. This intense bitterness is very well inserted and does not stand in the set which again the intrigue by brewmaster of magic that leaves the Tripel style get lost.
The ending is very bitter and rather dry, not taking too long denoting balance. For me this drink can have a single bottle the best of both styles: Tripel and IPA.
Alcohol is almost imperceptible in taste, but do not be fooled because the dragon is there! So the ABV 9% comes as a big surprise for such a refreshing drink.
Can be, despite the alcohol content, be much more balanced in terms of freshness verses depth of flavor compared to their American counterparts. Shows us a stunning fermentation technique and quite intriguing for this reason.
This valuable and powerful beer is easily drink on a hot summer day, but that our home should be very close to our legs due to the high alcohol content.
