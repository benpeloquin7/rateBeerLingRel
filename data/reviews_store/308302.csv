It started out fine, but got extremely dry after a while, while the taste was leveling. Not sure what the term for that is, but the taste sort of dissipated the more you had. We suddenly realized we had sitting around with this beer for a very long time, forgetting to drink it. Others on here describe the taste better, I cant remember very well because I was completely absent minded while drinking it. The only thing that was surprising was the sausagy hint of a porter, probably due to the oak that led to strangely comparable results. I was excited about it supposedly containing vanilla notes, but couldnt detect it. Its still solid though, its decent middle of the road, as can be expected from Steenhuffel.

Gollem has a bar in the same city where I drank Jacks, so that would make sense. 

Rating might go up as soon as I try a second one, we thought we got the last 2 glasses the bartender was able to squeeze out of the barrel. My beer tasted even more bitter than my friends, so it must have been bottoming out.

Good beer nonetheless, it was extremely agressive, but I like bitter. It was also completely opaque, which was fascinating but odd for an IPA. Could all be due to basically drinking pure residue. Tonight Im going back to that bar, it can only get better from here. Taste deScription will follow as soon as I had a second glass. ",93.524,Virvo,Belgium,5.9%,Gollems Precious IPA

Hints of the obvious ginger, albeit not so much the other supposed flagship product of cilantro. Then a lot of stringent sweet, raisin, a bit of citrusy herbs. Keep your beer cool enough, tepid makes it way too sugary. Overall a nice refreshing combination. The appearance is quite beautiful, but is obviously designed to rival the other amberish beer from Antwerp, bolleke, which is way more famous.
The taste is way more bitter than the aroma, it slides stinginly along the sides of your tongue and is quite oily that way. It bites like a sweet bitter much as an IpA would, but without the cliche taste. The ginger is probably responsible for much of this depth. The taste can get a bit exhausting after a while.
This beer will probably be rated lower by the mere reason of it being a sequel to the succesful first one, Seef, and because it rivals the bolleke in a way too obvious way. The taste is a lot deeper and heavier though, and recently I prefer this one over Seef. ",77.247,Virvo,Belgium,7%,Bootjesbier

This is one of those beers I would love to love more. Without wanting to diss it, it sometimes feels like this beer is appreciated for the fact that it has momentum instead of having momentum because its so good. Theres just no getting around Gouden Carolus the last 2 years or so.
The tripel seems to get very alcoholy and agressive after a while, that feeling where you get slightly annoyed and confused after the first few sips have settled. Its still a solid beer, but living in Belgium that means it ranks with a lot of other good strong blondes, so it misses punch. 
That does mean its pretty balanced though, instead of being another one of those modern beers with momentum gained by the original or hoppy flavors.
Just to be clear, the brown one is a whole different story and one of the best beers out there. ",97.756,Virvo,Belgium,9%,Gouden Carolus Tripel

Basically, if you think Christmas beers arent bad, but the elements never excited you, go for this one.


Im subjective because Im usually not that strong on Christmas beers, but this one ranks among the best. 
Its a little heavy on the sweet as with any Christmasbeer, but also heavy on some spices and alcohol mixed through which actually makes the blend better.
Heavy isnt a bad thing here, since everything is heavy and nothing oversteps, and Christmas beers usually fade into sweetish iron or clove that never lasts way too often. So this one has some balls, kinda fireish and spicier alcohol. ",97.483,Virvo,Belgium,10%,NIce Chouffe
