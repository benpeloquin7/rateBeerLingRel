Although it has 8.4 abv, the alcohol content is very balanced with the taste, which turns this beer into a very nice choice. The Aroma is very present and strong, with floral hints and definitely citrus. The appearence is exsquisite and the palate is very soft and light. Not very carbonated, just enough. Overall this beer is always a choice, especially during the sunnier days, and unfortunately the experience of drinking it cannot easiliy be put in words.

It feels as if very little effort was put into making this beer different and better than the other Super Bocks. Disappointing.
The Aroma was not felt at all, the taste is to watery, and overall it resembles a mass-production lager, which it appears the most. ",14.959,AndreLazarra,Portugal,6.4%,Cerveja Super Bock Abadia
