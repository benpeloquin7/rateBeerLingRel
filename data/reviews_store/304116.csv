Appearance is amber to orange in color, cloudy with floaters, decent head that laces the glass through a few sips. Aroma is nice but the taste is hard to figure out and at first seems beyond bitter to chemical/astringent, and then my palate seemed to adjust a little improving satisfaction. Im a fan of IPAs and this one falls in the middle of it ... better than most Ive brewed but room for improvement. ",92.936,Floater,Texas,9.2%,Southern Star Valkyrie Double IPA
