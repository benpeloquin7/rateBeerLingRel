Flavor is vibrant and generous with the nutmeg and cinnamon, tad of tingling pepper, some cola, essentially like drinking a cinnamon spice latte. Easy medium-light body, fairly slick mouthfeel, balanced carb. This is very very enjoyable.  ",99.418,mambossa,California,8.1%,Chris Banker / Insurgente / Stone Xocoveza Mocha Stout

Pours amber gold with off white head. Nose of spruce, nectarine, candied lemon, syrupy sugar and breadiness. Flavor is some dense syrupy honeylike malt with an assertive juicy apricot, tangerine and floral hop bite typical of any ASA. Slick, syrupy, smooth & silky mouthfeel. Pretty nice!

Im approaching this brew with the knowledge of FFFs dark beer game being much less satisfying than their pale ales. But Ill try to retain neutrality. Poured to oversized snifter, opaque with gentle mahogany shining along the edges, substantial dry-sand colored head that bubbles down to thin and spotty retention and clinging lace. I can smell the plum and dried fruit maltiness from two feet away. Stuck my (slightly stuffy) nose in there, getting notes of brown sugar and vanilla-like oak, noble hop, and a little bit of bubblegum/cola. Flavor starts off bubbly and effervescent, followed by some bittersweet caramel maltiness, finishing with a cola flavor as it goes down. Pretty bubbly. Medium body, medium oily-ness, manageable linger. Im assuming aged on cedar or possibly Oaked. Very subtle but familiar wood flavors and aromas. But hey, I like this. But not exactly running back for another. Definitely worth a pick up if you havent tried.  ",94.346,mambossa,Indiana,8.6%,Three Floyds WiseBlood
