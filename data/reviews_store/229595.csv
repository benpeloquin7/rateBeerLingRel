But definately pleasing with a rich mixture of flavors. Dries on the palate almost like a wine so the flavors are intense but fleeting. Mild carbonation, slight head clearing quickly with carbonation dissipating to a bitter reminder as it sits.  I find it presents flavor better when slightly warmer. All in all a very drinkable beer.
