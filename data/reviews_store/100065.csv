It did not disappoint! It is one of the few brews that falls into the category of a life-changing experience. Weve chronicled our unique experience at the Abby, drinking in the In De Vrede cafe, and successfully navigating the complicated process of garnering a few cases to bring home on the following blog. Hopefully, it will provide a little help for any other beer-lovers out there who want to get their hands (and taste-buds) on this sacrosanct brew! Check it out at:
