The advice of sellers ""this is a beer for 4-5 persons; dont drink it alone!"" made the beer more interesting. So i tried it with some friends. Too spicy for them! The head was represented by some seeds and a piece of chili. It has a special aroma of chocolate cakes, gold raisins, baked apples, alcohol and brown sugar. In its very first moment it has an intense taste of chocolate, smoked paprika, dry soil and roasted malt, but after two or three seconds all of this are covered by an intense hot sensation, amplified by a high carbonation. Its body is medium to full with a long aftertaste and ""red afterface"" for my friends. This beer was really different ",11.33,Vargatul,Spain,8.4%,Nmada Mole Negro
