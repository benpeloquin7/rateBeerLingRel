Thick appearance which shows its unfilteredness. Doesnt really look like an ipa. Upon first taste you definitely get the toasty malt. Its smooth but bitter on the tongue as the hops hit you hard. They also stay with you deep in the palate. This isnt your typical ipa and not a favorite but its very drinkable. ,53.38,brewpubexplorer,Vermont,6.8%,"Long Trail ""Sick Day"" IPA"
