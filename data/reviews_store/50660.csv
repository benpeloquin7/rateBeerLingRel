I had the good fortune of trying it the first time straight from the cask.  The aroma and flavor are straight hops, its like holding a handful of hops right up to your nose and taking a deep breath.  Its thick but not to hearty.  You wont need a nap after one of them.  This is one of the best beers Ive had in a long time. ",96.592,rleveret,Maryland,7.25%,Heavy Seas Loose Cannon Hop3

Aroma is pretty generic, color is a light yellow, very cloudy.  The flavor is full and it has a great aftertaste, citrus and yeast.  Ive had better, but I did thoroughly enjoy this beer.
