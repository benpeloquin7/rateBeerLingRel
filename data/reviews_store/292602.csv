Pours a nice pale copper with orange hues. Very aromatic hops in this beer, smells of citrus peels and hints of pine. It has light carbonation on the palate and finishes a little dry. Tastes of bitter or tart fruits and again I get pine. The malts round out the flavor and make this beer an easy drinker. Overall I think this is a great IPA.

Little carbonation in this brew but a great earthy, yeasty breadlike aroma. It almost smells like sweet pastries. On the palate it is slighty sweet with these straw-like undertones.
