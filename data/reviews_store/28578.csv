I drank Bally IPA in the 70s ( from Cranston RI) and into the 80s even after the move to Indiana before it was discontinued The current version is a disaster. It bears NO resemblance to the original of which I still have several bottles. This beer is wrong in so many ways; the grain used is wrong,. it lacks the characteristic hop flavor and aroma and residual sweetness of the original given the ibus and probably needs a better ale friendly yeast. The brewers should be ashamed of themselves. This would be thrown out in the first round of a homebrew competition ",90.995,gannsett,California,7.2%,Ballantine India Pale Ale
