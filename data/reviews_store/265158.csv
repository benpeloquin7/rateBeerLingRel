Head retention is limited being a stout. Aroma is caramel, chocolate but very weak. Really wanted alot more aroma. Beer in the glass seems abit thin without a hoppy oil film I was expecting. Head retention drop off after a few mouthfuls. Carbonation is excellent! Perfect!. Taste is caramel with coffee and chocolate abit sweet being 60 IBUs I was expecting a bitter element to cut through the sweetness. Mouth feel seems abit thin as I said before needs more body and oily residue in glass.after a few minutes of taking a taste the bitterness seems to try and cut through the malt. All around a average imperial stout but will be happy to buy again. For me it needed to be abit more heavy in the mouth with abit more bitterness to cut through the sweetness ",91.497,durry87,Australia,9.5%,Sail & Anchor Jack Tar Imperial stout
