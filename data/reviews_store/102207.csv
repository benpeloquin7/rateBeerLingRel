As a classic Scotch Ale, we expect a big malt and low hop profile. In this case, Ofallon has truly triumphed with the style. 

The initial aroma is mild and does not tip one off as to the wonderful complexity of the brew. The first taste reveals the candy malt and mild roastiness,  then moves on delightfully to the complex but well-balanced flavors of currants, plum, and a touch of rum. The mouth feel lingers and is buttery. The finish is slightly dry, and the hefty alcohol content never intrudes or overwhelms. Making a beer with really big malt flavor and high alcohol content is a real balancing act, and Ofallon has hit the jackpot with this one.
