Really, dirt. I looked at the bottle and it was bottled in Kenya--that means theyre probably using Kenyan water. With dirt in it. Really, Im surprised I didnt get cholera from drinking this. I immediately regretted my decision to order this, but I finished it, cursing Kenya Breweries all the way for putting this in a 16oz bottle. This is the worst beer I have ever had, on account of the dirt flavor. It might have been decent otherwise. ",5.282,hknight52,Kenya,4.2%,Kenya Tusker Lager
