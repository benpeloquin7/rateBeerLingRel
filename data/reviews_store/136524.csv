But the Pumking did not do it for me. Appearance and bottle design are amazing. But the taste is horrible. So many posts on how amamzing this beer is. I think it is awful. I was not ready for the Diacetyl taste. Maybe it was the batch that I bought from a new local craft beer store. The butter taste (I love butter) was over powering.  But dont worry Southern Tier, I will continue to buy your product.  ",97.262,Benjdrinker,New York,8.6%,Southern Tier Pumking
