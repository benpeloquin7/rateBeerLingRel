It costs between 10 and 12 dollars for a 6 pack which i think is way too high for a beer that to me tastes exactly like Budweiser.  The only aspect of this beer I actually like is the bottle itself and the simplicity of the label.  Other than that its a mediocre lager at best.

One can honestly taste the distinct flavor produced by the Belgian yeast in the brew and it only adds to the greatness of the overall flavor of the beer.
