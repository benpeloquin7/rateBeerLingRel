Beer itself is opaque.

Aroma is heavy malt, smoked ham, bacon.

Medium full to full body, creamy. Chockolate, coffee and some smoke. Warm alcohol, maybe a bit too warm. Aftertaste is dark chockolate. Light, balanced carbonation.

Overall a well crafted beer, dont hesitate to try it if you get the chance.

Smokey, heavy.

A bottle from TVR bought 10. of August 2010. Many bottles still on shelf there, will buy another one and age it.

Malty caramel aroma, hops not noticable in the nose.

Full rich body, medium carbonation. Malty, roasty, hint of burnt caramel, oranges and a hint of spice. Alcohol in aftertaste, but not out of balance, finishes sweet.

Will probably benefit from aging.
