Due to the great equilbrium the alcohol (18.2%) is well hidden, allowing all the great and variegated flavours to happily invade your mouth. The beer is pitch dark and oily with low carbonation and a nut colored foam. In my opinion its a great conversation beer to be shared with friends after dinner.
