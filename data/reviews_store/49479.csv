Caution must be exercised in that liquor stores are not refreshing the product and some (like myself) will occasionally find a store owner that doesnt expire a product and Hueberts can last as long as the the ones that use all sorts of techniques to avoid that (at cost of taste). If your beer wwent sour, Im sure they would replace the defective product.
