There was a very malty aroma with little or no contributon from the hops. The apearance was dark and moody, almost opaque with a frothy, medium tan head that was full of belgian lace. When you drink this beer, the most immeadiate thing you experience is an intense, malty taste that is very similar to a port or madiera. It has an underlying taste of heavy alchohol that makes it definitely a sipping beer. the finish is a short but moderately intense bitterness that is the first and only appearance of hop notes in the beer. The body is definitely very full, with a creamy/thick texture to the beer. A nice option for after dinner drinks. ",98.352,Machapuchare,Belgium,10.5%,Gulden Draak

The beer poured into a beautiful very lively head that was gone in about 30 seconds. The taste is wonderful. Malty without being to cloying, with a very nice bitter finish of gentle hop escence and alchohol. the body is medium/full, very nice to style. The texture was slightly creamy with a very effervescent carbonation. The finish is wonderful with the sweetness of the malt perfectly complimenting the bitterness of the hops. A very well balanced beer. A nice alternative for someone who found Saison Dupont too dry.  ",96.592,Machapuchare,New York,7.7%,Ommegang Hennepin

The appearance of this beer is one of its best qualities. It has a ghostly, hazily pale color. The head is gorgeous and full of beautiful belgian lace, and takes up a fourth of the glass. I am normally not a wheat beer fan, but the sour/sweet taste is wonderful. The body is light but satisfying, with a moderately thick texture, and highly effervescent carbonation. Utterly delicous.

It has taken up half the room in the glass. The whipped cream head full of Belgian lace is almost worth the price of the bottle. The aroma is full of hops and malt. The taste is extraorrdinay.
