I cant understant such low ratings on this beer. Its descent when it comes to taste, but its skunky aroma is definately what I like about heineken and will give it a 10 on aroma until I can find a beer that has an aroma that smells more like the real thing than this. Im sure it can be done. Hemp beer maybe. lol ",0.588,HendrixGarcia,Netherlands,3.2%,Heineken Premium Light

I would say its pretty good in the bottle. In my opinion I think it seems kind of watered down which may mask alot of the potential flavors that this beer may have. I  reallyhave a hard time believing that this beer won those medals, but I havent tried it on tap so I may eat my words some day. Coming from the bottle its worth a try, but its nothing too spectacular or memorable in my opinion. ",39.104,HendrixGarcia,Ireland,5%,Smithwicks Ale
