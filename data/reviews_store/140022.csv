Draw is medium to heavy hops. Finish is bitter and sweet like any good pale ale. After taste is non-existent. A good go-to beer when you dont know what to buy or are overwhelmed. You will not be disappointed with this. This brew is the reason why Sierra Nevada is the 2nd best selling brewer in the USA behind Sam Adams. Beats any domestic and almost every other beer (besides Anderson Boont Amber Ale) when one is looking for a beer to break out for a barbecue or company. ,94.655,killiana1a,California,5.6%,Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can)

Draw is best characterized as heavy apple taste or heavy acetyl in brewer speak. Finish is sweet. After taste is the same if not worse than any other skunky domestic lager. I picked this up on a whim; I should have picked up a 12 pack of Miller High Life if I knew it would be this quality. ,37.218,killiana1a,California,5.8%,Gordon Biersch Mrzen
