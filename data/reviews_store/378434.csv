I love the bottle design, the brew itself is dark and thick and luscious.
Flavorwise, on the first sip, all I could taste was coffee, there was hardly even any beer taste to it, everything down to the aftertaste was like a straight black cup of coffee. After enjoying it a bit more, I can pick up a little chocolate, and maybe even a little vanilla.
It feels like Im drinking milk, very full and soft palate. Ridiculously smooth and comfortable, helps balance out the bite of coffee.
Overall, I think this beer is lovely, but just not right for me. I would like to see a little more complexity in the flavor. ",93.134,NovaChaser,Michigan,5.2%,New Holland The Poet
