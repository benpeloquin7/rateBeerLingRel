Insanely opaque, to the point where I held my LED headlamp up to it and no light could escape.  Nose gives strong espresso and bakers chocolate, mixed with a hint of chicory and dark cherry.  On the palate, it is velvety, with an undeniable presence I would hesitate to describe as heavy; rather, the Imperial Stout is simply THERE, inescapable, not begging for attention but commanding it.  It is emininetly drinkable, with each successive quaff bringing more of the disparate but well-melded flavors to the fore.  The alcohol builds in small crescendos with each sip, warming, but not burning, mixing with the malts for a finish that lets you know you darn well better take another sip.  The hop character, so recognizable as Stones, is present, floating on top of the other flavors.  Its almost too much right now, but I have a few bottles in the cellar, and Id expect the chocolate and espresso to blend, the chicory to soften, and the alcohol bite to smooth out a bit over time.
Cant wait to taste this alongside the 2007. ",99.947,BlackJeremiah,California,10.5%,Stone Imperial Russian Stout
