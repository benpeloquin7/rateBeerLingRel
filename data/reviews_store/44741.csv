I fell in love with it after the first sip and I havent found a beer that I love as much since then. I am going to miss this beer when I leave Oxford and Mississippi! ,51.471,carbear,Mississippi,4.5%,Lazy Magnolia Southern Pecan

The Tandem is very rich and full of flavor right down to the last drop. ,80.441,carbear,Washington,7%,Pike Tandem
