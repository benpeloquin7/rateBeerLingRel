Hints of chocolate, coffee, not sweet, yet not overly hoppy.

Like most craft beers some batches are better than others, and this last batch reminded me of my first Hop Fusion which was excellent. The batch before this one lacked something.

The draft version of this beer, is by far my favorite over the two. The draft beer is about 9% alcohol, the flavor is still a bit sweet. Hints of vanilla. Very smooth and excellent overall flavor. Very deceptive with alcohol, be prepared for the Storm, it will hit ya.

Bottle
Tends to be higher alcohol than the draft. Being soo, it carries a more sweet taste. Same as the draft though. Great color. Great aroma. And approving flavor.

Both beers have been big hits with females, and those who favor for some reason the traditional beers. And dont want the hops.??? ",84.157,cmconrad99,Ohio,11%,Mad Brewer White Storm
