Nice smoky nose with a hint of sweetness. Hickory.
Appearance was a bit light for a porter. 
Taste was nice and smoky with a faint sweetness. Kinda how I like my ribs. Not a lot of porter flavors but the flavors were still good.
Palate was touch thin but still went down smooth.
Overall a really good beer that was more interesting than a lot of the run of the mill beers that a lot of places are turning out. Nice work! ",86.353,S8bored,North Carolina,5.4%,Fullsteam Hogwash

Appearance is dark with a beige had that doesnt last long.
Taste is all coffee up front with some hints of chocolate to follow up the rear. Delicious!
Palate was lacking. Quite thin for the big flavors and aroma. Easy to drink but disappointing when the rest was so good.
Overall a great beer for lovers of coffee and dark chocolate. Goes great with salted caramel chocolate and would be wonderful over some ice cream!  ",95.847,S8bored,Michigan,6%,Odd Side Ales Chocolade Koffie Stout
