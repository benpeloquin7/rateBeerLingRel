Drunk cold, as American light beers should be.  Drunk out of bottle, so no observations on the head.  Most astonishing thing was lack of any discernable flavor, either good or bad.  Id compare it to Natty Light but without Nattys sweetness on the end.

Victoria is pretty much the national beer in Nicaragua.  Its major competiitor are Tona and Buffalo.  In my opinion, Victoria is the best.  In Nicaragua, this beer is actually more expensive than their rum. Light yellow color, slightly hoppy, little head.  Best of the Central American beers Ive had, as is one of the few that didnt always taste skunked.  Good on a hot day with lime.
