Orchard fruit undertones buffer the coffee/choco flavors that reside in the middle of each taste. A sugary spicy finish ends up completing the thought, with spot on bitterness, whilst leaving ones palate slightly moist for the next gulp. Alcohol presence is less than detectable for an 8% stout, but overall mouthfeel and viscosity is a tad underwhelming. Slightly thinner than Id enjoy, with less carbonation than most comparable brews.
