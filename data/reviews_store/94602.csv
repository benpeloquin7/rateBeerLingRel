Great overall balance, awesome smooth amber color, and goes down super smooth.  Feel bad people outside the North East have limited or no availability to this brew as its very local.  Awesome super super cold from the tap...to me tastes a bit differnt from the bottle so i would say let it breath a minute if you only have bottles.  No let down brew all around. Great product!
