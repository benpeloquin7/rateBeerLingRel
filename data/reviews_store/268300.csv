The taste is the main thing and it tastes very much like a citrus style of IPA with some pine mixed in. Goes down very easy but is a strong beer overall. 
I live in central Oregon next to Bend so I get this fresh usually. While I was up in Portland and ordered it at a bar there it did not seem to have the same flavor. 
By far my favorite beer and being a beer drinker from Portland who moved to the Bend area I have tried a lot of micro-brews  ",97.811,Rabbott2014,Oregon,6.5%,Boneyard RPM IPA
