Looks delicious.  Smells of malt (caramel) and fruits.  Taste is bready, with faint hop notes and a long, somewhat bitter finish.  Pleasing to the palate and goes down easier than water for me!  Also makes the best Black & Tan (or ""Blacksmith"") when combined with Guinness.  Overall, my favourite Irish Beer.
[EDIT] - My 500ml can is 5% alc, but is clearly labelled Smithwicks Draught.  Not sure if I have reviewed in the correct section, but I imagine they are close enough in taste! ",24.061,Marco35,Ireland,3.8%,Smithwicks Draught

Pours 1 finger of head, but this subsides rather quickly.  As others have noted, there is a scent of citrus here - perhaps grapefruit.  Skunky european pilsner smell up front.  Taste is similar to an American light beer, but is actually well balanced and pleasant.  Smooth and refreshing on the palate - overall, a good beer... but far too expensive for what it is.  Found @ LCBO, $2.60 for 500 ml can. ",4.99,Marco35,Italy,5.1%,Peroni Nastro Azzurro

Not much life to this beer and the head dissipates within a minute.  Smells a bit off - sweet and sour, I guess, with a very mild hop aroma.  Taste is too sweet and watery; the brew is light/medium bodied.  Mouth feel is a bit syrupy.  Leaves an astringent or ""sharp"" aftertaste.  

Overall, will quench your thirst in a pinch, but most beers in this price point are better.  $1.95 for 500ml can - Ontario, CA.  Served in a lager glass. ",5.574,Marco35,Denmark,5%,Faxe Premium
