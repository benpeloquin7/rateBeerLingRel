This is my first review. Purchased this 1 pint 6 oz bottle at a Minneapolis liquor store. The top of the bottle is dipped in red wax and it has a small wooden medallion embedded in the wax that says ""2011"". Color is a deep amber; has an off-white head and pleasant carbonation. Smell is mostly alcohol with a little bit of raisin and some other fruit that I cant describe. First thing I taste is the alcohol. The second and third tastes that come to mind are cough syrup and fermented fruit. Overall, this is a decent barleywine. Well-made but not spectacular. I was expecting it to be more rich and complex. Thanks for reading. ",79.258,BigWeisberg,Colorado,10%,Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Barleywine
