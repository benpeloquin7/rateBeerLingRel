Lacks the full ipa bite, but has a distinctive, sweet, subtle flavor that complexes nices with the hops. Could be a liitle bit more bitter, butthis is the best ipa Ive ever had. Thats saying a lot.

Medium head that lasts for a decent while. Aroma gives an earthy, malty scent. 
 Taste similar to that of Shiner Bock minus the often skunky feature plus more of the signature yeasty maltiness.

Aroma fueled by carbs, yeasty and chocolaty. Sediment suspended in fluid. Bitter taste complexed with a medium sweetness from caramel, fruit, and malt. The alcohol content is very high, but is well layered into the flavors. A little too stouty for my taste.
