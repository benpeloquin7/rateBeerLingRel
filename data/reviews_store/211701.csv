This ESB is a lighter, more golden color than the traditional copper color English ESB.  The aroma is that of a traditional English ESB with distinct deep yeasty tones, but this one has a wave of floral, citrusy hops.  I also get a slight fusel aroma since this ESB comes in at 6.8%. The taste is surprisingly maltier and more fruity than appears combined with bursts of citrus from the hops.  It does have quite the lingering hoppy bite, which differs from a traditional ESB, but it isnt overwhelming.  This is a close relative of the traditional English ESB, and one of the best that Ive ever drank. ",83.193,christopherw34,California,6.8%,Anderson Valley Boont ESB

Pours a nice golden amber color with a nice white pillow of head not lacking retention.  The aroma of these hops are atypical to ""pacific northwest"" aroma that most IPA drinkers will recognize; although, Im sure they were grown in the region.  It has a very deep floral, spicy aroma with hints of citrus which, collectively, really bring out the aroma of the malts.  The body is equally as deep as the smell.  It has a slight sweetness from the crystal malts balanced with the toasty, grainy flavors from the Munich and pale base malts.  It is bitter and balanced with bursts of piney, woodsy hops which, coupled with the aroma, give it a complex hop balance. The palate doesnt linger quite as long as I wish.

From the nose, you can immediately determine that this is not a pale ale with American hops.  The smell is malty with a slight hint of floral British hops.  The body has a caramel/toffee flavors from the crystal malts, and a bit of toasty undertones. The hops are slightly spicy, citrus and floral, which are a bit underwhelming due to the sweet caramel/toffee flavors in the body from the residual sugars.  I believe this beer is more of an ESB than a pale ale, especially after getting the yeast on the tongue, but styles are blurred these days anyway.  Good beer, not great, and has potential if IBUs are reconsidered.   ",37.133,christopherw34,Missouri,4.4%,Schlafly Pale Ale

Hops impart a very fruity aroma balanced perfectly with the malts and yeast.  This beer has a slightly maltier flavor than bitter; albeit, the hops impart a great balance of grassy herbal with notes of citrus fruits.  The body has a terrific caramel toasty flavor imparted by the crystal malts and base malt (maris otter...optic?), which lingers in the mouth with a bitter finish.

Upon bringing the glass to my nose, this pilsener noticeably bursts with noble hop aroma, and holds a fluffy, foamy, white head with a golden appearance.  Unlike Two Women lager, this pilseners taste is not as acidic, and has a sweeter body and taste; a bit more towards the German style pilsener, but not as sweet as a traditional munich helles.  I assume this is due to the mash water ph.  In addition to the slightly sweet body, this pilsener has a quite spicy and complex hop bitterness that lingers on the palate. Dont expect some big, palate abusing beer in Hometown Blonde. However, for the style, New Glarus hit the nail on the head like always.
