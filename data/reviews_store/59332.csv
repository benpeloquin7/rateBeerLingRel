Ill have to disagree with the reports here complaining that this beer lacks character.  Ive only had it from bottles, and every single one has been stunningly fresh and delicious and better than any comparable brew Ive tasted.  Possibly its better than the German Hefes and American Wheats Ive had simply because of the freshness here; it is a local beer. ",22.207,walter23,Canada,4.5%,Wild Rose Velvet Fog
