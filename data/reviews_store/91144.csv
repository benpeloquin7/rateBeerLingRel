Thursday July 16th 2009

We poured this golden nectar at the recommended cellar temperature of about 50 degrees.  As the fermented libation fell into the glass the eyes is drawn to the bright but not overwhelming dark straw color.  It is a clear beer, which was of a little surprise to Doug, since he didnt think they had filtering devices in the realm of ancient brewers.

All of our scoring is based on a scale of 1 to 5 pints!

Appearance:  (Doug 4 pints, David 4 pints)

Dark straw in color, very clear, and minimal to diminishing head.  The pour is heavy but smooth from this 9% beer.

Aroma:  (Doug 4 pints, David 3.5 pints)

Off the bat David detected a mild to moderate alcohol nose.  Dougs aroma note is more of a slight spiced with clove and very slight fruity bread hints.

Taste:  (Doug 3.5 pints, David 3.5 pints)

Doug was able to detect the alcohol notes the David suggested off the nose.  Both raters felt that taste left us with some confusion as to what this beer is trying to be.  This is a very complex beer on the pallet.  Although for being as high in ABV as it is the alcohol is not overpowering on the complexities on your pallet.

Mouthfeel:  (Doug 4.5 pints, David 4.5 pints)

Doug and David both agreed this was the best component to this beer.  Wonderful and full mouthfeel.  Carbonation was wonderful, not to overpowering but not dished either.  With as much fermentable sugars that are/were in this beer during brewing Dogfish head did a masterful job of balancing carbonation in this high gravity brew.  This beer starts moderately heavy on the pallet but is so smooth like 18 year old scotch there is a sense of drinking something crafted and cared for.  Bravo Dogfish Head.

The Verdict: (Doug 3.5 pints, David 3.5 pints)

The fellas agreed again.  Dogfish head is a great brewer of beers but the alcohol notes detected by David and the overly complex pallet by Doug brought the Beer:30 scoring on this beer down.

Diminishing the Head:  Dogfish Heads Midas Touch is a big beer no doubt about it and being that its in the spiced and specialty category anyones ratings are completely subjective.  Beer:30 recommends that you get your hands on a bottle and try it.  We wouldnt recommend a 6 pack to try.  Find a good bottle house that will allow you to buy individual bottles.  Both Beer Advocate and Rate Beer have resources to find retailers in your area.

Keep on pourin

I think the label combined with the anticipation of drinking this beer left me with somewhat of an unfulfilled expectation.

I think one impediment of rating this beer is the temputaure at which it was served. As the beer warms it releases a richer nose profile much like walking from thru the front door of the flower shoppe and then going into the flower warehouse. As the beer warms below my nose as I type report the sweet malty tones are more and more pronounced with a delightful effect to my nasal passages.

I would try this beer again but make sure that it was served at a better temp - like 65 or so.

Prost!

Lower carbonation that I would prefer and no head retention.  Very cloudy from yeast build up in the bottle, as there was a distinct layer in the bottom of the bottle from falling out.

Great mouth feel and very smooth aftertaste.  Bold malty flavors with a hint of caramel. 

I wouldnt call it a session beer but great to have one or two with a meal or just by themselves.
