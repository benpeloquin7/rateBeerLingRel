Anyway, this beer is as close to a home run as Ive had from this new-ish brewery. They have a solid smoked porter and a decent IPA but what I like is their willingness to experiment. This beer has a really wild lime and hop citrus nose, and it persists. Good looking beer with a decent but not overwhelming head. It doesnt waste its 8%, its mouth filling and warming and strange, with the gin barrels (I guess) adding a really interesting and pleasant character. Its good from start to finish, not 100% perfectly integrated, but really good.

The brewer Dave is really pushing the edges with some fruit experiments, at the brewery recently I had a mango infused saison. Very good (not as good as this), interesting and drinkable.
