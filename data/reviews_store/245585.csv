Ap:  Looks like a blonde white-wine, like your standard cider.
T:  The taste comes on quickly but also fades fast too.  There is a tiny bit of aftertaste but it is only mildly of apples.  It all tastes of plastic apples.  
P:  It has a nice carbonation balance that is mellow but follows through quite nicely.  Tastes like a red delicious, bland.  Sweet, with only a bit of dryness but it is nowhere near the sweetest I have had.
O:  Out of the mass produced ciders this is quite good.  It is up there with the Angry Orchard Ginger.  However, it is just a straight forward ""cider"" that is just very regular and standard.  To me it is like the red delicious of apples.  Nice looking in the bottle, but a bland sub-par apple compared with the large variety out there. ",20.812,gillagorilla,Belgium,4.5%,Stella Artois Cidre

You would think it is an excellent IPA.  Lots of grapefruit scents.
AP:  Very light yellow like a nice white wine or champagne.  No head or bubbles.
T:  If you didnt know this was a mead, you probably wouldnt be able to pin it down.  It tastes more like a quite dry cider with a bit of hops.  The hops make it taste much more like a beer, or a lager.  However, it makes it taste like the kind of beers I dont like (I cant pin the exact type, but to me it is like Yuengling (not good).  It gets more hoppy like an IPA the warmer it gets.  The hoppiness depends on the sip.
P:  It is quite dry and move through your mouth easily and smoothly leaving very little of an aftertaste.  The slight aftertaste is of hops and light tart citrus.
O:  It is very unique.  However, it tastes like something that seems common, but really isnt.  Actually, it is quite complex. ",49.206,gillagorilla,Michigan,6%,B. Nektar Evil Genius

Ar:  The smell reminds me of my trip to a local farmhouse cidery.  It smells like freshly mashed apples.  This smells very good.

Ap:  It is a very muddled, cloudy yellow-gray color.   Not much else to say, since there is no lacing and no head.

T:  Not too sweet and not too dry, just right.  I tend to favor the sweeter ciders, which is less traditional.  I like to be able to taste the apples, which come through very well.  I dont know if it is the pilsner yeast or the added apple juice, but this is delicious.  It tastes like a carbonated unpasteurized cider direct from the cidery.

P:  This is quite nice with its light carbonation that you feel down the middle, but other than that it is very smooth.  

O:  I was so glad to finally see this out by itself on the shelf and not in the variety pack.  This is probably my favorite Crispin outside of the limited editions.  It is much better than their other regular reserves. ",87.133,gillagorilla,Minnesota,5.8%,Crispin Artisanal Reserve The Bohemian
