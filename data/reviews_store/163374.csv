Really amazing earthy flavor but ultimately just too much going on in this brew. The sour, whiskey, hops and wood is just kind of one too many. Also, out of a bottle, I feel this is quite over carbonated. Worth a try, but not a repeat.

Nice amber color with a solid head and nice lacing. Clean hop aroma that eludes to the piney hops that lay ahead. Well balanced with a clean malt backbone. Citrus and pine hops are the star here, and star they do. 

Beer would be better with a bit more carbonation. I think the hops would pop a bit more and reduce the hot alcohol.  

Great brew, ABW. Keep em coming.
