Available via cask (at least the night i was there) at the linkery in san diego. Entire table agreed that this was heaven on earth. cask moderated some of the intensity and added a smoother more robust finish lacking in some san diego ipas. The grapefruit intensity of the hops was mellowed by the cask and was delightful to smell in a balloon wine glass.  ,99.046,Dpopkin,California,10%,Ballast Point Dorado Double IPA
