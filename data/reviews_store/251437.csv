It looked nice and promising, placed in between the ipas and tripple. Nice top when poured, although it disappeared quite soon but that might have been the hotel wine glass. A tastefull little too hoppy afrertaste, I like an IPA full of hop but this doesnt fit the taste of the pilsner like beer. Smells really good somewhat fruity hops. First zips had typical cardboard-like, muffy bite, hence my rating. Have to say the last few zips were much better probably because the aftertaste now has fully taken over my taste and i am now expecting the worst.
