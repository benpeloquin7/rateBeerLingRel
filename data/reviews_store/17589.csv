One of the best beer I have ever had. BUT WAIT!!!! There was the second bottle in which Chef Frankie(at MaHaffeys Pub), dropped the bottle into a pale of simmering water. When the nectar of cherries reached 100F, we sampled something that was ment to be sample by the best of the gods. This was hot cherry cobbler that mom would be proud of. This was quite simply the best thing i have ever drank. Chef Freddy and just stared at each other, smiled and nodded. No word necessary. Enjoy this with the family at christmas, I know i will!
