The mocha head laces prodigiously until it settles down to a wispy film for the last half pint. The aroma of rich roasted caramel malts is paired with a herbal hoppiness and figs. The initial taste again reveals the caramel, but this is soon cut into by the leafy hops, which lend a pleasant bitterness to this drink. In fact, this is probably the only porter Ive had where the hops have been given this prominence. Adding to this the melange of well-meshed traditional porter flavours of roasted malts, chocolate and mild coffee, and you have a winner.

The pour is a very dark clouded orange, with a minimal, wispy off-white head. A little more head would have been nice, but the depth of the body colour compensates, and helps the drink to look very attractive in the tulip.

The aroma smells strongly of raisins that have been soaking on brandy. Its rich, deep, sweet and malty.

The aroma of the aforementioned fruitcake is the big hit in this. It smells smooth and rich, full of spices that are not overplayed, but well-meshed instead. The flavour is impressive and soothing. There is quite a lot of caramel malt forming a backdrop against nicely balance cinnamon and nutmeg flavours, along with the hint of pine, before leading through to a slightly dry finish.

After beer 101, I drink some (more of this later), agitate the bottle and create a creamy mocha head to top this onyx beast. What a difference a head makes! the appearance is exceptional, and will remain so throughout, leaving prodigious lacing.

The aroma is nutty, chocolatey and rich, and after sipping I have to say that it is excellently matched to the drinking experience. My first impression on sipping is caramel - theres a lot present and it lends a nice sweetness to the drink, which along with its heavy texture, reminded me of sipping on chocolate milk. Hidden behind this are flavours of roasted malt, caf mocha and vanilla. The alcohol is extremely well-concealed, and only became apparently when I started nibbling on some Ghiaradelli dark chocolate while drinking. It turns out that the sweetness performs a function. The finish is smooth and creamy, but also shows the impressions of a nice hoppy bitterness.

Last night I found a pint of glory placed before me.

A mocha head happily sits upon an extremely dark brown nectar. Vinous aromas mix with dark fruits to achieve a somewhat festive feel. Upon tasting I can clearly identify the Christmas cake elements:raisins, sultanas and either fig or date (I always get the two confused). There also seems to be a touch of hard liqor in there, but maybe Im just imagining a brandy soaked Christmas pudding. Its quite delectable to have all of these flavours mixed with the traditional rastiness of a porter. Its capped off with a perfectly chewy mouthfeel, deserving of the brews name.
