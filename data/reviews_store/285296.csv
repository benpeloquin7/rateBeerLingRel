Finishes roasty-bitter, medium dry, with a lot of coffee again, some liquorice, some cocoa powder.

Very nice. Not sure if this should be categorised as a Dunkel, as this is all about the added coffee, with the typical aromas of this style very much in the background. Quite simple, but with lovely, direct coffee notes for coffee-lovers like me. ",96.308,Saeglopur,Poland,6.7%,Pinta Im so horny!

OK, but not my cup of tea, as I dont like peat. The nose is almost only peat, taste is a bit more varied, with some dark malts and fruit notes. If you like peat dominated beers, this is perfect, but Im not one of those people. ",86.875,Saeglopur,Sweden,6.1%,Nrke Anders Granssons Bsta Rkl

Nice one. Well balanced between sweet fruits, smooth malts and medium bitter hoppy notes, although the hops are a bit in the background. Interesting beer, but not the best one from both brewers. ",89.803,Saeglopur,Germany,6.2%,Uerige / Kehrwieder Jrn Grnhopfen-Sticke

A bit light bodied for the style and not very complex, but still a very nice, aromatic, strong Stout. Well integrated coffee, providing a dry, wooden roastiness. The ABV is greatly hidden, drinks quite smooth. Not among my favourite style examples Ive had from Sweden, but enoyable nonetheless. ",88.056,Saeglopur,Sweden,9.2%,Sundbyberg Lasse i gatan (2015-)
