Batch 2015. BBE 29.03.19 Warmth fills you from the first sip. Aroma of earthy peppers, honey, wooden casks, burnt sugar, massive malts and all is submerged in alcohol haze. Darker and clearer than 2015. Flat as the country it is made in - i.e. very gently, tiny carbonation bumps. Perfect for the style. Pleasantly sweet, yet dry. A bit mouth numbing, peppery, and very closely reminds me of good Scotch. Sugars are complex, and actually somewhat of a faro style like. Look for them - youll love it. No excessive hoppiness nor bitterness. No yeas leftovers, no unnatural esters, no wet cardboard - just pure malt extract and sweet sweet alcohol. Maturing will do some good to it. I am already hyped to get barrel aged version. In comparison to the last years one - this is more mature, more complex, more smooth and much more balanced. I liked the last year a bit more: it was raw pure energy, never done before in Estonia, it was more fun and it was 1/2 the price :-) This is like single malt whiskey - you pay more, and do not drink it but savour it.

Pours hazy dark brown with thin brownish head. Aroma of malt, raisins and sweet licorice indeed. Very close to dunkel, but is weizen and indeed super malty as a good bock should be. Tangy and fizzy, with medium body and a creamy finish. A bit dry. No 8.2% is noticeable at all. One bottle is more than enough for a person. A close sibling of Aventinus Eisbock but rather more gentler. A superb brew! ",99.63,Senka,Germany,8.2%,Schneider Weisse Aventinus
