If you like Belgium style, you&apos;ll love this brown ale! Pours beautifully with nice head. Smooth, effervescent with mild chocolate and malty. I always have this on hand.

Nice nice color, weak head, although with a little more aggressive pour cascaded nicely. Goes down easy, light flavor for a stout, not bitter, not sweet, chocolate yes, marshmallow? I wish. Bet it would be good on tap. Worth a drink.
