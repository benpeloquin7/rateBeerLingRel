It pours a tantalizing black/brown with ruby edges, the head doesnt last long but while it does its light tan and fragrantly frothy - as it fades it leaves little islands behind, but not really lacing.

The smell is of dark-fruited malts and with a tinge of smoke and perhaps a bit of light soy sauce. It tastes of cherry, dry cocoa, vanilla, soy sauce with a warming dark alcoholic taste. The aftertaste lasts with a nice bittersweet quality. Long into the aftertaste a grassy black licorice taste emerges - after at least a minute.

Maybe I will favorite this one.

DFH always satisfies what Im looking for, even when Im not expecting it. For the most part Im not a huge fan of big, dark, sweet ales. On the other hand, they offer a range of tastes and aromas that few other beers can hold a candle to.

Raison Dtre is a perfect example of what it should be. A great grape/raisiny darkness, the beer sugars weigh it down a ton, which is nice but makes it a bit much by the time I finish it. I stand behind my 4.3 rating but its still not a favorite.

(I know that a lot of my ratings tend to be high for good beers, but to my defense Stella is 2.7 and Labatt Blue is 1.7. - Im willing to give low ratings when need-be.) ",94.716,jaysonwhelpley,Delaware,8%,Dogfish Head Raison D Etre

This is an interesting concept, a couple of proto-beer styles mixed together in a way that I guess we can start to expect more of from DFH.

I have to say I really enjoy this one as well... itll never be my favorite, but I do like something new and weird every once in a while. I have to admit that Id never heard of Sahti before today, Id definitely be interested in trying some of it in its purest form at some point.

The aroma is out of this world, and absolutely perfect and exactly what I expected when I picked up the bottle! The only 10 Ive ever given for any category.

This is like a wonderful ""Belgian Beer Gingersnap"" if you were to take that cookie and dip it in a sweetened Rooibos tea. Im liking the chai-ness of it, the clove, coriander and cinnamon aroma and taste; the rustic aspect of the sahti is drawing me in as well - I love learning about where beer came from way back.

The clodded cloudiness reminds me that there is real biology going on and I like that a lot! If I saw this on tap and I was in the mood for a nice chill desert - Id choose this over cake or ice-cream any day.

My first impression after pouring it (750 ml) was the floating clods of yeast... a great sign in any Belgian.

Im amazed by the ""American-ness"" of this Tripel. Someone elses review also mentioned the Saison-type tastes in this one as well. Im loving the perfect hoppiness  that accompanies the sweet, dry yeasty-ness.

Its a supergreat American-Hoppy Belgian Belgian Tripel. I like Belgians a bit, but not my favorite. This, though, is a great Belgian. ",87.303,jaysonwhelpley,Belgium,8.5%,Scheldebrouwerij Hop Ruiter

I had the 2010 batch and was super excited when I saw this in my new-dad gift from my step father. Its the absolute perfect summer beer. 

The mid level sweetness, significant hoppy bitterness, that touch of acidity that makes lemonade so quenching Im just sad that its so hard to find (especially in PA). The parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme are evident in it and makes it taste like a perfect summer day would. 

Spicy/herbal without being too much, and it plays so nicely with the hops. The haze borders on cloudy like every good Saison should and the citrus notes in my nose and on my tongue are incredible. 

There is a reason this has .2 points higher than any other beer that Ive rated. I need to get my paws on more!

I would rate this lower on the overall (despite good categorical scores) if it werent for the aftertaste. Love the nutty bitter aftertaste, this is the other thing that I am astonished with about this beer. Long lasting bitter that makes me understand the style name.
