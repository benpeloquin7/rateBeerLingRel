Alcohol in the aroma along with peaches and honey. The alcohol is in the taste but not overpowering. Strong yeasty flavors along with some sweetness and banana. Contrasts quite well with the maduro Im smoking. Overall a pretty good Belgian style. ,95.079,danrc4,Pennsylvania,9.5%,Victory Golden Monkey
