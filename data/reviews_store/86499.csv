I love this beer.

This is, without a doubt, one of the most interesting beers Ive ever tried. Its made with a generous helping of smoked hemp seeds (hence the name and the smoke flavor other reviewers have referred to).

The body and color is typical of a brown ale. The mouth feel is solid if unspectacular. The head is about a finger thick, and the lacing is good.

However, what makes this beer stand out is smoky aroma and flavor. The best way I can describe this beer is that it tastes like somebody rolled a joint using bacon instead of paper, then smoked it around a campfire.

Yes, thats right - it has definite bacon flavors, and although this sounds awful, the actual taste is delicious. You will not find something similar anywhere else. ",84.157,JeffreyCHall,California,6.6%,Hollister The J
