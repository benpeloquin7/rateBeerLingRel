Ive had a lot of the rock bottom beers, most of which I dont see listed here.  but this was certainly one of the better ones.  this place really just doesnt seem to make beer that well for a restaurant whos entire marketing scheme is targeted toward their beer making ability.  The first time I went to this restuarant  I could tell i was getting ripped off.   I still go there cause they have great food, a lot of which is made with their beer.  I just suggest saving your money and getting a water instead of an overpriced and unfulfilling homebrewed beer.  The pesto pizza and  sausage soaked beer pizza is highly recommended.
