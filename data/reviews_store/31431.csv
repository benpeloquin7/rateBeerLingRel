Apperance is nice when poured into a glass.  Nice, thick foam and very good lacing.  Aroma is OK, but gets pretty sulfury as it warms.  Taste is pretty decent and has a nice malty end.

Lets face it, the hardest type of beer to make is a light lager.  Without big flavors, there is nowhere to hide brewing errors.  With BL, AB makes a clean light lager.

To put this in context, we are talking about a good value for the cost.  My critisism is that the brewers came really close to making something outstanding like the Winterfest, but it didnt quite make it.  The apperance and freshness of this beer were great.  There were a couple issues with the aroma a drinkability.  The aroma was similar to the Bohemian lager aroma.  Maybe it is an excessive acetyladehyde I get from an incomplete fermentation or shortened aging time.  The taste lacks complexity and is somewhat coarse.  But again, something definately worth trying and worth the money.  Given the choice, I would purchase the Winterfest. ",27.018,brauer,California,7%,Trader Joes Hofbrau Bock
