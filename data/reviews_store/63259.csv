A drinkable wit offering from A/B, quite similar in texture/mouthfeel to Blue Moon.
An almost overpowering orange flavor aspect with no detectable hops. As with the Blue moon, there is very little (if any) yeast component and, for the style, is quite watery. On a hot day, this would pair well with, say, a shrimp cocktail or a Cobb salad. But if Hoegaarden is on the beer list, dont even think of drinking this otherwise basic wit-go with the real deal.

Pours almost black with light tan head with thick lacing. Slight roasted malt nose. Creamy mouthfeel-very little carbonation. This is an elegant stout with just enough chocolate notes mid-palate to make you truly want to savor every sip. I have had this stout on tap and it had overpowering coffee notes which took away from any chocolate flavors, but in nitrocan this is truly an outstanding well-balanced stout. Thank you Youngs!

Pours golden yellow with decent head. Medium bodied with slightly fizzy carbonation. Incredibly floral nose with notes of grapefruit rind and pine. Solid mouthfeel. Finishes with explosive bitterness on the tongue with absolutely NO malt presence whatsoever. This is a Hopheads beer, period. Although I do like the IPA style, this one is way too one dimensional for my tastes. ",96.705,Alemaster,Pennsylvania,8.5%,Victory Hop Wallop
