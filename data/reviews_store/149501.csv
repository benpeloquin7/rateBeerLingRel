Not only is it co-brewed with Anders Kissmeyer, who received the award for Best Brew Master by the Scandinavian School of Brewing, but it is also made with the best selection of Lebanese herbs. These include zaatar (wild thyme), sumac, mint, anise, and chamomile. It is based on the English IPA but has distinct Lebanese flavours and aromas. 

A: Great amber colour. When being poured an off-white creamy head about a centimetre thick forms, and lasts for around a minute. Not too many CO2 bubbles visible, thus not over carbonated. 

S: Smells of all the herbs that must have been added during the boiling period. The strongest being that of the wild thyme with a tiny hint of citrus. 

T: Very unusual and unique taste. Theres a little bit of caramel in there, but the zaatar comes out on top again, leaving a little bitter after taste. Is full bodied. 

Absolutely love it!
