What was Miller thinking? First, I do not drink light beers. I listened to what Brewmaster Joe Pickett said ears ago when asked if he would brew a light beer. He stated ""If you want a light beer put an ice cube in it.""
However, My daughter purchased the Miller Chill for a family picnic. One of the worst beers I have ever tasted. I thought maybe it was conflicting with the food I ate at the picnic, so tried another at home. My conclusion was the same.
Appearance pale yellow. Aroma of a slightly lime and something else. Flavor is a little limey, somewhat sweet, lightly acidic. Leaves an aftertaste of something else other than lime. Did they also ad salsa or a taco? Will not purchase it again. 
My Daughter could not finish hers, hence I still have three bottles that will take up space in my bar cooler for years to come. ",0.147,Nutcracker,Wisconsin,4.2%,Miller Chill Chelada Style
