Beautiful aroma immediately after opening. Slightly deeper amber color with a beautiful head that sticks to the glass. Flavors include grapefruit, honey, fresh cut grass and floral notes. The 100+ ibus are intense but balanced out beautifully by the maltiness, which has a really nice sweet undertone. Started this one out at cellar temperature but it seemed to get better as it warmed up. I must get some more of this beer, it is definately the best offering from Stone yet.
