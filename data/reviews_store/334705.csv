A stout that comes as close to perfect as you can get. The only thing stopping it is that it just doesnt quite have the mouthfeel that a dark brew should, as if they held back giving it that motor oil feel. Do not be fooled though. This beer is top notch. Pair this with a good brat on a cold day. ",96.761,DurinsDraft,Maine,7.5%,Allagash Black
