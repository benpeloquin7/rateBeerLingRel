Poured from a cask: Nice burnt amber color with a nice head and floral citrus aroma.  Good balance of flavor, bitter, piny, and sweet up front and a little dry in the finish.  This is my pre Twins game warm up bar, it will be a sad day for me when the baseball stadium is built on the other side of downtown. ",99.471,thebeergut666,Minnesota,6%,Town Hall Masala Mama IPA

A great hazy amber pour leaves a rich white head.  The citrus aroma is quite strong, but the balance of bitter and sweet gives this beer its character.  Im nice and close to the brewery so I try to grab a couple of growlers every Saturday. ",99.524,thebeergut666,Minnesota,6.2%,Surly Furious
