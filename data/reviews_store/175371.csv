Bottled, drunk gently chilled. It pours like cola and smells like Pepsi, with a delightfully massive blackberry squash hit. Theres an odd hint of idodine or chlorine on the nose, which Im into. The mouthfeel is very odd, its far too thin and a bit soapy for a real porter. It helps the beer go down, but a porter like this should be more of an oral adventure. It tastes good, though. Not too sweet, but a jelly bean flavour slides pleasantly down the sides of the tongue. Jolly nice toasted biscuit base, and theres a sort-of strawberries and cream element in there too. Im a bit disappointed not to have detected the coriander in there anywhere, but its a pretty tasty beer. ",59.192,MrHayden,England,4.9%,Atom Dark Alchemy

On the nose, there was an immediate and very serious hit of hoi-sin sauce, with a tickle of fruity jam, and a very subtle saline hint which struck me as the aroma of pork-belly. Fantastic. A lovely treacle-ruby colour in the glass, with very little head or lacing from the tap. There was absolutely no front of tongue alpha-acid kick, but the coffee lends the beer a dominating back of tongue English ale bitterness. Sweet plum flavours, a touch of latt, and a gentle yoghurty aftertaste. Jolly nice indeed.  ",84.157,MrHayden,England,6.8%,Mad Hatter American Psycho

Even if Im having to remind myself that its there with each sip. Almost entirely lacking aroma save the hint of honey, but with an acceptable sweetness and very subtle hint at some Belgian influence. Nice effort, Carlsburg. Keep at it though. ",7.173,MrHayden,Denmark,7.2%,Carlsberg Elephant
