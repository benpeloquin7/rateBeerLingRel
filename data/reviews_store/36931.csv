It is now getting distributed around the continent with some popularity.  It was just in Gres Anatomy.  This beer is crisp and when it is fresh/cold it cant be beat.  It gives you character.  All the styles out of redhook are phenominal.  ESB is a classic. ,42.195,redhooked,Washington,5.8%,Redhook ESB
