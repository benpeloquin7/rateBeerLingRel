Roast coffee and raisins up front followed by a rich chocolatey sweetness with a long pleasantly roasty finish that flirts with bourbon barrel oaky woodiness at the very end. Full-bodied, a little weighty and light on carbonation, possibly due to bottle age. Sweet, mouthcoating and mildly coffee astringent. Another respectable imperial stout from Evil Twin that embraces the roasty character of dark beer without allowing it to overpower the way so many do. Really like to try this one on tap or newly bottled to see if that offers a little more carbonation to manage the weight of the beer a little better. Still not a bad beer by any measure. Skal!

Taste is not just generically of wine, but very distinctively Cabernet Sauvignon followed up by a super sweet wave of cherries and crisp apple tartness on the finish. The distinctive flavor and mouthfeel of Cabernet tannin is unmistakable. Really heavy bodied for a cider, mouthcoating and astringent just like the wine grape its aged with.

Pours a crisp golden yellow with a slight rosy tinge, exuberantly fizzy with two fingers of bubbly cottony white head that dissipates quickly to a foamy ring, and bubbles all over the glass that just keep rising and rising endlessly like something out of a major domestic beer commercial. I honestly think this is the first time Ive ever witnessed a beer this fizzy in person. All saltwater up front, followed by rather vaguely defined fruity sourness and some maltyness mid-palate, finishing salty and a little starchy with a little bit of the plasticky chemical preservative taste. Not strong or show-stopping though, actually most of the flavor elements, with the exception of the salt, are subdued and delicate, and not nearly as intense as the nose suggests. Just a tangy twist on traditional gose beer for the most part. Light, crisp, refreshing. A little bit seawater astringent, but extremely easy to drink especially on account of the almost surreal endless bubbly carbonation. A very nice gose. Came in expecting more of a fruity character based on several others Ive had recently, but the subtlety of the fruit doesnt really detract from the overall quality. A much more traditional and straightforward take on a gose than Evil Twins other, similarly styled Mission Gose, which I also reviewed about six weeks back. Id do this again, why not?

Pours oily black like a Guinness with a finger of creamy tan head, no effervescence on the glass to speak of. Head is persistent with nice lacing. A lot darker than I was expecting, as the label calls it an Imperial Ale, when it looks and pours very much in the character of a stout. A whiff of ginger up front followed by a nicely balanced combination of medium-roast coffee and bitter chocolate, followed by sweetened ginger and chocolate bitterness accompanied by pleasant malty alcohol warmth on the finish. Full bodied with just enough carbonation to keep it from being oppressively heavy. Strives for creamyness but doesnt quite pull it off due to the strength and persistence of the coffee and chocolate flavors and strength of the alcohol. Mouthcoating and rather sweet, only mindly astringent. A unique and interesting take on a stout. Almost strikes me as an eccentric attempt at a winter warmer or Christmas beer.

While Im not really a fan of Ginger Beer (proper noun) I guess I was expecting this to be more along those lines than it is.

Pours 10W-30 dark amber with less than a finger of head, even pouring hard, that dissipates in a minute or two into delicate lacing. Effervescence on the sides and bottom of the glass also dissipates quickly. Taste is strange, not bad but strange.

Creamy, medium body, big reduction effect from the vanilla, mouthcoating but with great carbonation to help balance. Certainly one of the sweetest stouts Ive had in recent memory. A bit of an overcompensation for all the stout beers on the market that are overly roasty, I actually find this one a little lacking in that dimension resulting in this super sweet concoction almost more like a malt or milkshake than a beer.

AROMA Rubber cement/skunk smell... uh oh. Lightstruck? Mercaptans? Faint coffee, smoke, bit of citrus acidity.

APPEARANCE Dark cloudy amber, almost soda pop orange liquid with half a finger of fizzy head that burns off in a couple of minutes, effervescence clinging to the sides and bottom of the glass. Tremendous amount of sediment material, I should have poured more carefully. Didnt anticipate that, no live yeast or sediment warning on the label to prepare me.

TASTE Medum roast coffee, coffee grounds, vanilla and isopropyl alcohol. Highly competitive, raw overpowering flavor elements, cant possibly have been the brewers intent.

AROMA Muted aromatics, really have to get my nose down in the glass to get a whiff, or maybe its the last beer still lingering on my palate. Coffee beans, cocoa and Hershey bar. More Hershey bar than anything else.

APPEARANCE Pours darker and more coffee-like than Mikkeller Dessert. No head to speak of, only a thin layer of bubbles that dissipates in the distance from the kitchen to the den.

TASTE Flavor is much better than smell. Really well integrated medium roast coffee and chocolate bar with a soft airy vanilla finish that lingers a long time without being offensive.

PALATE Medium to full body lightened by vanilla, slick and mouthcoating with a long finish. Not a creamy or sticky beer.

OVERALL Very good. The aromatics are simpler and more subdued than Mikkeller Dessert and were difficult to tease out on its heels, but Vanilla Shake is really quite a good well-integrated beer with better balance than most stouts, and not as much cavity-causing potential as Mikkeller Dessert.

AROMA Hershey syrup, chocolate cake batter, dark baking chocolate and brown sugar masking a hint of banana sweetness underneath. Unexpected. Nice.

APPEARANCE Pours deep brown to black with a finger of frothy, persistent tan head with light lacing. Very well carbonated with bubbles on the sides of the glass.

TASTE Sweetened condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, caramel cream and a long finish of bitter dark chocolate. Very sweet, I guess only to be expected from a beer called Dessert.

PALATE Medium to full body disguised and lightened by vanilla. Excellent carbonation in my experience for a bottled Mikkeller brew. Slick, sticky, chocolate bitter and mouthcoating with a long finish. Not a creamy beer, which isnt necessarily a criticism, just an observation.

OVERALL Very good. Extremely sweet, chocolately and indulgent. One bottle is enough, the beer is excellent but too many would land you in a dentists chair for sure.

The brew I ended up settling on is Brash Beers Smoglifter, easily my favorite sweet stout, and probably my favorite stout of the decade overall.

AROMA Dark chocolate, chocolate milk, chocolate milkshake, toffee, cane sugar, caramel, and light roast coffee. Faint traces of plum or raisin hiding underneath. Roasty coffee notes are definitely present but very subdued compared to most heavy stouts and very delicately and exactingly balanced against all the other elements.

APPEARANCE Pours dark from the very first drop, reminding me of the color of Kahlua with an extra dark tan to brown head less than a finger deep, but it hangs on all the way down. Bubbles on the bottom of the glass, not on the sides. Picture perfect.

TASTE Roasty coffee and dark chocolate up front, dark chocolate and milk chocolate in the middle, with a long finish of dark chocolate and caramel sweetness punctuated with a pleasant belly warming alcohol effect. A roller coaster ride from lips to stomach.

PALATE Full bodied but light, lively but not fizzy, creamy, easy, and satisfying to drink.

OVERALL A real treat. One of my favorite beers. Makes me want to curl up in front of a roaring fire with a dense slice of biscotti, chewy icingless brownie, or even a box of chocolate graham crackers, letting it soak up all that malty goodness. This beer is like a tall glass of chocolate milk for a grown-up, and really makes me back to when I was about 10 years old in some strange visceral way. Brash Beer is a young operation that seems to have transitioned majorly in the past 2 years from Massachusetts to Texas, and from wide national distribution to regional taproom focused business.

APPEARANCE Pours a nice dark amber filling the glass with familiar deep oily dark liquid with a thin head for a stout, hardly a requirement but always an attractive bonus with a dark beer. Light to moderate effervescence with a few bubbles on the sides of the glass and trace lacing around the rim.

TASTE Distinctive light roast coffee flavors up front and mid-palate with a mild sweet milkiness moving in behind reminiscent of cafe au lait. Sweetness comes on quite late and lingers on the finish leaving the mouth and teeth sticky. Carbonation is good keeping the beer nice and light and drinkable. Alcohol is well integrated and not obvious.

PALATE Full bodied, malty, heavy, creamy and mouthwatering. Deceptively light with good effervescence.

OVERALL Another one of those beers that seem like an incredible mismatch of aroma and flavor, but not necessarily in a strong or offensive way Ive found other beers guilty of. Aromatics are amazing, flavor isnt bad, looks and mouthfeel are respectable. Not a bad beer but too bad it doesnt deliver more on taste for upwards of $15/bottle.

APPEARANCE Beautiful golden straw yellow pour with good clarity, highly effervescent with bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass, frothy white bubbly head reminiscent of seafoam burning away to nice delicate lacing.

TASTE Really salty. Salty and sour. Saltier than any gose Ive ever had to date. Flavor profile doesnt quite live up to the aroma, mostly salty and sour candy sour without much of the anticipated citrus flavors. Theres supposed to be herbs, moss and seaweed in the beer too, but I cant say I detect anything like that.

PALATE Light bodied, fizzy, astringent in an unusual way due to the high level of saltiness, makes the mouth water a great deal on the finish with all the salt and sour.

OVERALL Alright, not terrible. Better paired with something rich or sweet to take the edge of the extreme saltiness. Not well suited to extended drinking on its own.

No alcohol smell to speak of, in contrast to several other heavyweight stouts Ive sampled recently.

APPEARANCE Big voluptuous caramel colored head frothing up like it wants to overflow the beer glass. Dark oily liquid with perfectly balanced carbonation, keeping it light on the palate without being fizzy.

TASTE Sweet, roasty without the intense coffee notes of many of its peers. Nice balance of malt, sweet, acid, bitterness and creamyness with a well integrated lingering hint of vanilla. Not so much like vanilla ice cream as much as a nilla wafer.

PALATE Light, creamy, smooth, viscous and mouthcoating. Well calculated carbonation lightens up the weight of the beer admirably. Very refreshing as dark stout beers go.

OVERALL Even better than expected. A highly drinkable, exceptionally balanced sweet stout.

APPEARANCE Familiar deep Guinnessy-black color with a lot of effervescence clinging to the sides of the glass at first. Very little head to speak of, foaming up upon completion of the pour and dissipating to just a trace within minutes.

TASTE First sip sweet, milky and sugary. Second sip roasty with powerful coffee notes. Cafe au lait? You could convince me this was sold as a coffee stout. Wasnt expecting that. About as sweet as my palate can tolerate. Unbalanced but not offensively so, coffee and milk flavors competing for attention with each successive sip. Short finish, doesnt linger.

PALATE Full bodied, creamy and rich, viscous and mouthcoating.

OVERALL Its alright. Hard as I try I cant seem to get away from the fact that its a whole lot like Guinness, but a good deal sweeter and more coffee flavored.

TASTE Woah! What was that. Second sip. Big explosion of ripe juicy lemons and grapefruits up front, a rich buttery saltyness in the middle, finishing clean with a fresh lemongrass flavor that lasts just long enough to satisfy without overstaying its welcome. Almost like a shandy but no sweetness to speak of, gentle hop bitterness and salt taking the place of that element instead. Very nice.

PALATE Light-to-medium body, slick texture with good effervescence and a moderate salty astringent finish.

APPEARANCE Slightly spotty head with a nice caramel color and a thin head that burns away fast and just clings to the glass in a nice silky ribbon.

TASTE Malty, chocolatey, a little roasty with a touch of bitterness. The alcohol burn arrives fashionably late just as the last roasty notes are fading. Great balance among all the different flavor elements. Not actually as sweet as it smells.

PALATE Full bodied, thick and creamy, just enough carbonation to keep it from being heavy or syrupy. Nice long finish with a slow evolution of flavors that invites contemplation.

OVERALL One of the most expensive beers Ive ever bought. Fantastic even at $20/bottle. Lots of flavor complexity that changes and evolves as you work your way through the bottle. A nice long finish.

PALATE Featherweight, fizzy and refreshing. Malt beverages dont get easier to drink.

OVERALL Not bad. Sweet, light, gingery and refreshing. Less complex than NYF Root Beer sheerly based on the difference between multi-botanical root beer and single-botanical ginger ale.

APPEARANCE Indistinguishable from Coca Cola to the eyes. Deep caramel color and unusually effervescent with short-lived bubbly head and a few tiny fingers of lacing.

TASTE Intense, powerful flavor of fresh coconut and coconut candy, intense to the point of overwhelming everything else. The malt, the roast, the fruit and spice characteristics, such as there are, cant stand up to all the coconut and wind up lost and difficult to distinguish in contrast. Truth in advertising to a fault I guess.
