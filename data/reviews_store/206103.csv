Aroma was unpleasantly sour - like overripe and slightly rotten apricots or grapefruit so ripe theyve fallen from the tree. Flavor is overly acidic and sour with no balance - dry and fruity in the extreme without any balancing malty or sweet character. Too one-sided, even for a sour style.

Aroma was butter, brown sugar, alcohol, caramel, and black pepper, with hints of bing cherries. Mouthfeel was smooth, almost a bit thin for a stout. Again, the defining characteristic was the contrast between the volcanic rock ashy smoked malt taste and the sour pear or apple taste from the acidity, ",63.019,Scrivartha,Colorado,,Funkwerks Belgian Oatmeal Stout

Collins, this one had the best beer, and this beer was the best of the best. Aroma was typical Saison - lemongrass, jasmine, caramel, straw, hints of spice from the yeast, and with a higher abv of 8%, definite alcohol notes. Flavor is rich, slightly sweeter and more yeasty than a standard Saison style, but still with pear or green apple flavors. They claim tropical fruits like passion fruit or mango, but honestly if those existed at all it was only because of the strong, souring effect of the saison yeast, and I think standard fruit is more honest (in other words, there is no fruit in the beer, and its not particularly ""tropical"" - its just marketing.) Dry finish with a lingering, slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was slightly warm - the alcohol is definitely detectable. I definitely bought a few bottles to bring home to AZ.
