Green bottle wrapped in paper. No bottle date found. So thats what they mean by resin.

Poured into Duvel tulip glass. Murky brown. Four finger off white rocky head that dissipated rather quick. Resin, pine, pineapple, cough drop and green apple come to mind in the aroma. A good amount of bitterness. Pine, grapefruit and a touch of alcohol burn in the throat with a lingering bitterness. 

A decent beer that Im glad I was finally able to try. You wont regret getting yourself a bottle of this. Im just not sure Id go out of my way to get it again. ",98.405,mloula,Denmark,9.6%,Mikkeller 1000 IBU
