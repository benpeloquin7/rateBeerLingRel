Poured a clear dark amber color with a dense, lush tan-colored head .

Smell: Aroma of pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops.

Taste: nice IIPA bitterness.  Not the same complexity of a PTE but very drinkable.  

Palate: Quite smooth on the palate. Mild carbonation.

Overall: It was a great winter seasonal that i wouldnt mind them turning into a regular.  One of Mendocinos better beers.
