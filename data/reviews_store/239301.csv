No other beer produces such nasty amount of burps.
Amste;, Bavaria, Pirlsner Urquell , Grolsch, are similar of taste or quality in one way or another, and do not make one so gassy... That is why after some sampling I will abstain from this very label. ",6.156,Irrelevant,Germany,4.7%,SPAR Ludgers Gold
