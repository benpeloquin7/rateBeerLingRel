Smell- Wonderful citrus aroma. Nice hints of orange and lemon zest. Nice barnyard funkiness with hints of spices and hops.

Taste- A nice grain taste with hints of orange, lemons, spices and a sour funkiness. Very clean and dry with a nice bitter finish.

Mouthfeel- Has a nice creamy mouthfeel with a medium high carbonation which gives it a nice crispness.

Overall- Another impressive beer from Jolly Pumpkin. This one isnt my favorite but is still a top notch, interesting brew. These beers make me want to try more wild ale beers!! Great stuff! ",95.019,Beerbuddha,Michigan,4.8%,Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca
