It pours an unclear orange golden body under a creamy off-white head. Cute lacing. The aroma is quite heavy, with pine cones, peaches, some alcohol and a pleasant malty touch. Lightly alcoholic flavor with oranges, citrus, bitterness, and some malts. Peach hints. Full body, some warmth and a nice carbonation. Lasting fruity, piney finish with malts in the back. A bit heavy on the alcohol, but a tasteful and pleasant beer anyway. 160407 ",,yngwie,Norway,8.2%,Qvart Double Trump (Imperial Pale Ale)

Its an unclear orange colored beer with a minimal sized white head leaving lacing. Oranges, pine cones and some resins on the nose, with some hints of malts. Its medium to full bodied with a soft carbonation. Quite dry. Oranges, pine cones and resins and a fine bitterness in the mouth, lasting for a good while. Very refreshing and easy drinkable.

It produces a lot of light beige foam over a lightly hazy light brown body. Lacing. The aroma is a bit weak I think, with dark caramel, some roasted malts, a hint of ham and bonfire and some citrus hints. The flavor is likewise, weak, with a fine bitterness. Full to medium body and a bit heavy carbonation, semi dry. Long finish with more bitterness than smoke. Drinkable and flawless, but too heavy on the carbonation and lacking on smoke. In my opinion. 160407 ",69.779,yngwie,Norway,6.2%,Bdin Still Smokin

An almost clear one, rather pale golden in color and with a dense, finger thick white head. Lacing. Grassy, lightly fruity nose with biscuity pale malts and then even more grass. Its smooth, medium bodied and quite dry on the palate, with a fine bitterness, and flavors of grass, pale malts and a faint piney, citrusy hint. Long grassy finish with pine cones and some citrus. Far from the most exciting beer from this brewery, but its quenching and easy drinkable, could be a summer hit. 160407 ",,yngwie,Norway,4.5%,Ngne  German Pale Ale
