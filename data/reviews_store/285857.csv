Some spice, but not picking up the coriander. Crisp and refreshing. Deeper aromas a-la caramel and butterscotch emerge as the beer warms, but there isnt much development. Taste is thin and lacking complexity while cold -- wheat and lemon with a dry somewhat hoppy finish. Like the aroma, the flavor palette remains steadily on the bland side even as the beer adjusts to room temperature. Carbonation is thin and body is light. Lacing on the glass is sparse. Bottom line: For a mere 8 shekels (half the price of an Israeli craft brew), one cant say this is that disappointing; but beyond being a decent drinkable beer, it has a ways to go before it can be considered a quality Witbier.

As the beer adjusts to room temperature, a woody alcohol aroma is given off and the Belgian yeast character comes into sharper focus, with the butter aromas transitioning into cheese.

Aroma is yeasty up front, very leafy and doughy, with malts prominent a-la hay, and floral hops - sweet, balanced and very pleasant.

Well, with quick action catastrophe is avoided. On to evaluating the beer. Pours an amber/apricot color, a little hazy, with a finger of foam that settles to a soapy film. Base of bottle is coated with yeast, and the bottle itself is lined with lacing from top to bottom. Visible carbonation in the glass is relaxed. Aroma is sour up front, very yeasty-moldy, followed by alcohol, vegetables, earthiness, and faint general fruitiness.

Aroma is curious: dominant malts a-la toffee and caramel; with a deep breath you do get alcohol in the nose; some red wine hints as well. Hops are more subtle -- grass for the most part. Yeast imparts a barnyard funk. But the undisputed focus is on the malts. Aroma gets a 9 only because its not super intense. Taste doesnt disappoint, either. Definitely feeling the alcohol, but in a decidedly positive way. Really the base is the alcohol, with dark-fruit nuances of cherry and blackberry tagging along and fading in and out mischievously. Not much in the way of bitterness to speak of, but theres spice for sure and some of that grass is there as well. The label on the beer promises honey; but compared to, say, a wheat beer, theres little if any honey coming through here. Palate gets a 5 for being unique, intense, memorable, and enjoyable. Carbonation is medium (not visible unless glass is tilted), so is the body. As beer warms, the alcohol gets noticeably more pungent both as far as the aromas concerned and in the flavor.

The aroma is really compelling, its hard to resist diving in with the mouth. Taste is delicious caramel malt up front -- makes me think of a tootsie roll. It then shifts into red grapefruit, intensely delicious, bitter hops. Medium carbonation makes all the flavors animated and dynamic in the mouth. Mouthfeel is generally medium -- not watery, not quite chewy.

As the beer warms, the floral notes open up nicely. Taste resembles nose but thankfully a lot less mild -- very nice and somewhat complex balance between floral hoppy bitterness and slight molasses/licorice malt/yeast. No fruity notes of any kind from the hops, just floral, and the hop profile opens up nicely as the beer warms in the glass, like a daffodil bush in the early morning hours. Mouthfeel is lower side of medium, but I found myself sipping slowly to enjoy the hop/malt oscillation, which endures like an echo after each swallow. For a pale ale it does what its supposed to, foregrounding neither the hops nor the malt too much one relative to the other. The taste is certainly of a quality craft beer.
