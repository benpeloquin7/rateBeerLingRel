Its a flavor you definitely have to get used to, but once you do youll be hooked too. Its a spicy beer with a distinct taste. the chili is a hybrid of a jalapeno and a milder chili pepper. You need to drink a 12 pack before you get hooked.... Cheers!!         ",0.147,jacky,Arizona,4.7%,Cave Creek Chili Beer
