Nice straw yellow color, white head, dissipated quickly. Funky taste, almost condensation like tasting, possible sanitation and cleaning problem. Thought it may have been a different hop variety, but not, possible musty grain? Off flavors though. Nice and light on the palate, crisp finish with a grainy malty flavor through the nose. I love the Helles style, and this was not as enjoyable as I was expecting. ",18.202,dswillieus,Tennessee,5.2%,Smoky Mountain Velas Helles Lager
