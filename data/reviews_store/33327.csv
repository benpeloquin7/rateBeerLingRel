This brewery has always struck me as one that never wanted to step too far out on a limb flavorwise and this beer falls in lock step with that philosophy.

There was also an interesting spiciness underneath the hop bitterness. My initial impression was that it was somewhat unbalanced but as it warmed the malt backbone really took over and made for a more mellow experience.
