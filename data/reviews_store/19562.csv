This was drunk regularly when I lived in Rome and it stood out as being a very tasty beer with a satisfying long finish. There was also a stronger Super Devils Kiss weighing in at 9%.  Both were served on draft but available in bottle landside at Leonardo Da Vinci Airport.  I have never seen it for sale anywhere else. ,8.185,JazzPuppy,England,7%,Rose Street Brewery Devils Kiss
