Such a beautiful place with such splender and majesty this beer has alot to live up to. At first glance its light and with a personal preferance of  dark more heavy beer I was reluctant . First sip is pleasant with a delectable aftertaste a bit tangy but thats not the right word.You could put this beer in orange juice. I recommend this beer for picnics, the beach,or romantic dinner maybe shrimp pasta or pork tenderloin. remarkably refreshing I could put it in my water bottle on my mountain bike. I hope to see many more flavors from the leelanau brewing company. Maybe something with a little more amber color. I also love the bottle! ",94.408,papabear,Michigan,5.2%,Leelanau Whaleback White
