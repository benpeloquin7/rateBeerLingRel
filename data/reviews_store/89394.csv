This awesome brew is the first Coronado Brewing Company offering that Ive really liked.  A deep red color with strong and pleasantly sour aroma. Taste was complex but not overbearing, with definite bourbon notes and sweetness.  A slight sour finish. ",,danwho,California,,Coronado Red Devil - Barrel Aged
