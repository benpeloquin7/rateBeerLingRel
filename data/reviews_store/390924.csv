The brewery played with a lot of carbonization. It is interesting. It is very interesting but nothing I would order a second one. 
Very nice bitterness and aftertaste. For me the carbonization is too strong for the rather flat aroma and taste of this beer.  ",,Riddesummer,Bulgaria,6.7%,Blek Pine Sofia Metal Fest IPA

Nice aroma of mango. The bitterness is well balanced while taste could be stronger.

But fine IPA with a splendid fruity aroma. 
Crisp. Fresh. But not wild in any case.
