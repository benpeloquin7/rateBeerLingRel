Not much lacing.

Aroma:  A definite peachy, over-ripe apple sourness.  There is also some noticeable malt in the nose as well, some biscuit and subtle fruitiness.

Taste/Mouthfeel:  The beer opens up with a nice kick of carbonation and some slight bitterness.  The flavors roll in with a restrained sourness that is quenching at first but drops off quickly, attributing tart and ripe peach, cherry, apple flavors and then moves into some malt sweetness on the back end.  The finish is drying but there are some sweet after flavors.

Overall, I was hoping for more from Driftwood, but it is a solid brew nonetheless.  The beer has nothing that is overpowering, but it does not have anything that grabs your attention either.  It is a well-brewed sour-brown, but definitely not the best release to have come out of their doors

Poured a hazy gold with minimal head.  The aroma is very bready with just a little funk, and the taste is the same.  It finishes smooth and dry.  I dont think I would buy again, there are way to many other examples that blow this one out of the water. ",70.555,OBerwanger,Texas,,Southern Star Walloon

Aroma is of rich, roasted chocolate, espresso, and cookie.  The taste is more of the same with a substantial sweetness that is balance out by a heavy hand of hops.  This is all complimented by a very thick, creamy and smooth mouthfeel.  Overall, this is an extremely rich, well balanced, and delicious Imperial Stout.  One of my favorites.
