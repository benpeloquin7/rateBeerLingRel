It has stong chocolate and caramel flavours while smelling of old style breweries. Deep in colour almost ruby rather than brown, dark yet inviting. Not too strong and so very quaffable ale, always worth a swift on on those cold winter evenings. ",69.126,CidermanUK,England,4.3%,Timothy Taylor Ram Tam
