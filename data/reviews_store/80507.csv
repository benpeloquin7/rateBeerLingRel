The  beer tastes very non offensive almost salty sweet with brine and peanut taste. A taste of  freshly baked breate with almost  no  taste  of the %6 ABV. Taste this as soon  as  possible. Not the best  but still great. The  appearance alone is worth the try. ,74.666,skidney,Germany,5.8%,Paulaner Original Mnchner Mrzen

Smells like of course a malty wheat. Pours pitch black with a thick tan head that  lasts and lasts. It tastes of bread coffee and a fine cigar this taste  lingers  for a  good  long time. I generaly buy  singles but I buy a 6 pack at  a time with this one. If you dont  try this your  selling yourself short. ,54.698,skidney,Michigan,5.6%,Arcadia Starboard Stout
