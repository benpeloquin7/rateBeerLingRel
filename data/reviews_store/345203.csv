It is by far the best beer I have ever had by Samuel Adams, but not the best stout Ive ever had. It is smooth with a short head and dark as night. The merry maker is extremely drinkable and for $5.50 for a bomber at 9% ABV, at that price you need to pick one up. ",95.258,goresk23,Massachusetts,9%,Samuel Adams Merry Maker
