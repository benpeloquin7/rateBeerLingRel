Fetish is one of those rare breweries that is extremely small in size (just above home brew) but makes exceptional beers. In my mind submissive is one of their best. All of their beers are live, with lots of yeast and no filter. Very murky,which gives it incredible flavor. I don&apos;t think these would keep very long and they&apos;re meant to drink extremely fresh. But this is one of the best IPAs I&apos;ve had in my life, and if you get the opportunity to drink one that&apos;s fresh I&apos;m sure you will agree.
