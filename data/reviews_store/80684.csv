One of the best porters Ive tasted. Dark, good-looking porter. Not a massive mouthfeel, just a shade more than a mild. Medium-dry, biscuity taste, good bitterness from both hops and roasted malt. Carried through by just enough alcohol (but not too much).

I could probably drink it all day, although I suspect that would be inadvisable. ",97.096,russss,England,6.2%,Thornbridge Evenlode
