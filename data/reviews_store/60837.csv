Over flow was not from tipping bottle. Lost 1/3 of bottle.  Lacing was  great but very frothy. Head went away quickly but left froth. Very sour, but was not  expected from reading lable. Quite tasty because unexpected experience.  Did not realize sour taste excentuates quiet flavors. 
Frothy lacing goes away quickly which is dissapoiinting. Overall would purchase again knowing the smoothness of drinkablity is there.  Not my favorite type of beer; but for me quite drinkable.  ",98.244,redneckfinder,Michigan,6.5%,Jolly Pumpkin Luciernaga  (The Firefly)
