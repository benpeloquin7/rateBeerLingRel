No overdone bitterness. Foamy head lasts several minutes. Light amber color. Light hop aroma with a hint of malt. 9% abv is hidden in the flavors. Sweet, slightly floral romantics. Nice malt back bone balances the more subtle bitterness. A very pleasant beer to drink. Not over the top , but made to sit back and sip in a chair and relax. Two of these and you will be in a very relaxed state. I really enjoyed this interpretation of a double ipa.  ",92.737,profhuggybear,Utah,9%,Squatters Hop Rising Double India Pale Ale

Aroma is very pronounced vanilla and some dark Malts. Taste is a balanced porter with a good hop bite to keep the sweet malt from over powering. The vanilla is present from beginning to end and is very pleasant. Delicious porter that easily made it into my order a second list.

Smell is light, sweet and pleasant. Tastes of slight hop bitterness, honey, sweet corn and a pleasant malt flavor. A slight astringent note can be detected. Very affordable and above average for this style. As the name suggest it is highly sessionable and you will be reaching for a second not long after you pour your first. A very well made to style beer, it&apos;s just not a style a lot of people are crazy about. 

I have enjoyed this beer for many years. It is always stocked in my beer fridge for any occasion. Pairs well with almost any food due to its light neutral flavor profile. It is a beer I will hand to non beer drinkers and they often are swayed from the opinion that all mass made lagers are tasteless garbage. Added bonus is that the short stubby bottles can fit on a rack the same height as a 12 oz soda. Cheers.  ",26.672,profhuggybear,Oregon,5.1%,Full Sail Session Premium Lager
