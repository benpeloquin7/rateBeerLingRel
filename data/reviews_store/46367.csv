I had a bottle, which poured a nice orangish amber with white head that lingered for a while. The smeel is trong, clean hops. The flavor is much smoother than the full-on hop assault I expected. Im a confirmed hophead, but the balance and subtlety of this beer were truly surprising. It finishes clean with a very nice hoppy aftertaste. Would make an excellent session beer. This compares favorably with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, for example, though I suspect price differences might make that comparison useless. Good stuff.
