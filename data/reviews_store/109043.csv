Pours a beautiful dark amber with a minimal light tan head.  Aromas of bourbon are the most apparent, followed by coconut, vanilla and light grapefruit/citrus notes.  Taste is medium sweet balanced by light bitterness.  Medium-full body, a thin, slightly creamy texture, soft carbonation and a rather clean finish that leaves just enough bourbon/coconut flavor behind to make you take another drink.  By far one of the best beers Ive ever had and I would go out of my way to buy this beer despite its rarity and limited release.  Bravo Hardywood Park!
