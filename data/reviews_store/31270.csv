Delicious black porter, perfect for the winter months, a bit thick for my palete, but very delicious. Amazing unique taste and smell.  Had a slight acidic aftertaste that I didnt go for, but I would buy again as it was a solid brew. I used one bottle for beer brats, works quite well for cooking too!
