Aroma: Caramelized oats, roasted grain and slight coffee.
Appearance: I only rated a 3 out of 5 since I had it straight from the can. From what I could tell, the color is dark, dark amber brown.
Taste: Nice creamy, soft roasty, nutty and slight chocolate. A bit dry at the start, but opens up to a slight sweetness. 
Palate: The cans actually have a little bobber inside that creates a nice foamy, smooth texture. Creamy, thick and soft.
Overall: An excellent stout in my book. I really enjoyed this brew. 
A WORD TO THE WISE: If you do get the 16 ounce cans with the bobber inside, make sure these babies are nice and cold. If they are warm (and I KNOW a cold stout can sound like heresy to some) they will overflow and youll sacrifice a lot of great beer.

Aroma is lemon, lime and grapefruit. I detected a bit of a hoppy nose as well.
Appearance is darker than I expected, but suitable for a pale ale, the head disappears as soon as it is poured, but is a large-bubble clean white. 
Taste is medium to light bitter with a kick of hops and finished on a slightly green and hopped flavor. The palate is carbonated and light, with a quick bitter finish.
Overall I was happy I tried it, but I wouldnt get it again if I had other choices. Its definitely not a bad beer, but all in all, its not New Belgiums best offering.

Aroma: This beer has a light, cereal aroma with notes of effervescent citrus, a summer hay field and dinner rolls.
Appearance: Cloudy, pale golden straw. Very typical wheat beer appearance, nothing unusual or noteworthy for that matter. When poured into a glass, the foamy, white head disappears quickly. Not surprising for an unfiltered wheat in my experience.
Taste: Refreshing taste, very bread-like and balanced.
Palate: Carbonated and lively with a medium bitter finish.
Overall: Ive always liked this beer and still do. Its a go-to wheat (although Im a bit biased since I live in Kansas) and I will continue to drink it. Not a bad brew and definitely worth a try, especially if you have an affinity for wheat beers. ",42.87,mgrafton,Missouri,4.4%,Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat Beer
