The chocolate and coffee malts make for a rich creamy taste with just a slight bite to the finish. This beer is so smooth and easy to drink and as much as I wish that the glass would never end the 9% abv sadly leaves me to only a glass at a time. ,,Courtneys,New Mexico,8.5%,Tractor Brewing Luna de los Muertos
