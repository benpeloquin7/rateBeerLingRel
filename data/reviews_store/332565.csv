Cider doesnt deviate from apples. No hops. No yeast. Less on the bubbly carbonation. A stale carbonated beverage mellowed out gulp that has a longer lasting effect of mellow nature. Extends the need for the need of the next watering hole.  ,70.038,tittruffletat,England,6.5%,Henneys Vintage Still Cider (Bottle)

Malt is steel reserve. There is no hops. No noticeable yeast. But you have to be a real vanilla lover to appreciate this beer. I stick to vanilla for ice cream. It has a smooth finish nonetheless that is a good break from harder& edgier beers.  ,65.234,tittruffletat,California,5.2%,Mother Earth Cali Creamin

This is my first rating here for my ""beer outside of beer"" experience. The long finish stands out for me. My beer palate is still fresh. This being my first rate I dont have a lot of comments on taste and aroma although I thought it had a somewhat neutral aroma. I enjoyed it with an Umami burger. The two went great.
