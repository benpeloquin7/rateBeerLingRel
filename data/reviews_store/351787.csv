Although light it packs quite a punch and reminded me of the old unfiltered Ratsherrn pale Ale, Riedenburgers Dolden Sud, Crews PAs... modern classics if you wish (I live in Hamburg, so from a German perspective). It is a great beer. I cant believe this is only 35 IBUs; being low in sugar and alcohol it comes across way sharper and fresher (well it says 45 IBU elsewhere I see now). In the midst of a rainy London December, this made me think of summer again. Shows the essence of an IPA; perhaps less post modern, than prototypical.
