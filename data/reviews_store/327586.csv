I love beets. This was so good. Red brew with a pink head. Bright as hell. Hoppy and beat nose. Subtle beet-earthy flavor with a wine like quality and cereal notes throughout. Balanced well and easily smashed. 

My only question... can I substitute for Jamba Juice?  ",67.536,C1tySurfer83,Colorado,8%,Bull & Bush Turnip the Beets

Copper colored and bright. Lasting sticky white head. Super pine grapefruit nose. One of the most well balanced IPAs I have ever had. Hints of caramel/toffee back and forth with grapefruit. Finish was my favorite. Huge fan of dry hopped brews. This was clearly heavily dry hopped. Little to no grassy notes on the nose. pleasant and lasting resinous after bite. Dangerous IPA as it was easily quaffable. I would compare this to a dry hopped Dales Pale Ale. ,61.047,C1tySurfer83,Colorado,6.5%,Dad & Dudes Dank IPA
