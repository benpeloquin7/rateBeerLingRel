The smell was very strong in terms of citrus and floral hops with also a hint of sweet bready malt.   The taste really was something special.  The sweet malt flavors and a mild citrus bitterness hit you at first.  Mid-Drink you are tasting the sweet malt flavors again but the hops are starting to dry  your palate out a bit.  In the end the dryness and bitterness kicks in at the right time leaving you with a wonderful lingering bitterness that has a sublet sweetness to it. The mouthfeel was medium with a fair amount of carbonation, it really fit the hoppy nature of this beer very well.  Drinkability for me as a Hop-Head was very high.  This is as close as Ive tasted to a Christmas DIPA.  I see myself buying more of this because I completely enjoyed every sip and was sad when my 22oz bottle was finished!
