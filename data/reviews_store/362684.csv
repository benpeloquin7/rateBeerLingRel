The Sticky Dog Stout was a wise choice. It has a very smooth chocolate and rich roasted coffee flavors. These are a few of my favorite flavors combined. A pleasant aroma to the nose as it swirls in my pint glass. As a stout should be, it appears as a black broth which would be very suitable in recipes calling for a beer. This is an excellent beer and I recommend you give it a taste test. Cheers! ",,bianchiveloce,North Carolina,5.75%,Nantahala Sticky Dog Stout
