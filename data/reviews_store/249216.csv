I can see why they named it. Almost no aroma just a hint of chamomile. Tastes of lemon and pinapple fruit flavours on top of a light malt base. Softly finishes with also light and dry bitterness. A nice drinkable beer but not one you would boast about. ",25.62,Col_Trickle,Australia,4.7%,Matilda Bay I.G.P. (Itchy Green Pants)
