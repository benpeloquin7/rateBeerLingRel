Tall boy can served in a Prairie teku

A - Pours a clear chestnut brown with a solid off-white head. Average retention and lacing.

S - Toasted barley, clean citrus hops, nut bread, caramel, earthy.

T - Follows the nose with toasted barley, toffee sweetness surrounded by earthy tannins, peppery hops add firm but rounded bitterness, English yeast profile, nutty and bready, citrusy hops really starts coming off once warmed. Finishes nice and very dry with pecan like bitter tannins.

M - Lush body with great carbonation, firm but sloshy. Dry tannin-bitter finish.

Its a hybrid English/American strong ale. Strong toffee/barley flavor, toasted with a rounded earth/tannin character. The citrus hops are semi spicy and paired with the firm lushy body makes for a nice drinking beer. This surprised me.

12oz bottle served in a Duvel tulip

A - A hard pour reveals, dark ruby/brown body, nice clarity with a finger of tan head. Beautiful beer.

S - Roasted ashy malt, smoked molasses, very spicy aroma, rich and acidic fruit comes out with grapes, cherries, tobacco, burnt candy sugar. The fruit takes on a cooked character once warmed.

T - Spicy fruit, scorched cherries, acidic grapes, theres an odd smokiness to the malt, an alcohol sharpness that cuts through the sweet malt. Finishes astringent with flat cola, spicy alcohol and charred malt.

M - Medium to full body, semi-syrupy feel, low carbonation.

This is some odd flavors going on. Definitely a unique Quad...or beer for that matter. Grapes and cherries seemed to dominate the fruit profile especially when warm. There was a burnt charred character running through the entire beer and the heavy handed alcohol seemed to disrupt rather than add to the flavors. Not my cup of tea.

Review from notes:

A - Hazy light brown with big bubbled head. Low retention with minimal lacing.

S - Sweet woody malts, sugary fruit, apples, caramel, muddled whiskey aroma.

T - Starts off with sweet caramel malts, slightly toasted, very fruity, mainly apples, woody tannins, theres earthy/spicy bitterness but its hard to detect the source. Theres notes of mild earthy hops underneath the rounded nutty malts. Finishes semi-dry with notes of fruit and toasted wood.

M - Medium weight with active carbonation that mellows out as it sits. Woody tannins are left on the aftertaste.

Interesting brew. The malts and fruit combined with the wood create a complex mix of flavors that seem uncommon.

2012 and 2013 were poured in a side by side taste test.

A - Black as night with a dense dark mocha head that takes it time going down. This coated my glass turning it brown.

S - Bourbon, vanilla, dark caramel, loads of sweet barley, cherries, decadent chocolate, strong coffee, very rich aroma. More vanilla and cherry in the 2013. The 2012 had more of a leathery/melded caramel malt aroma.

T - Big bourbon flavor, thick caramel with a hint of char, huge vanilla and amaretto flavor, aggressive whiskey soaked wood, a complex mix of cocoa, coffee, sweet dark fruit, alcohol was more evident in the 2013. The finish flashes all previous flavors with a nice whiskey roundness.

M - The silkiest, smoothest beer Ive had to date. Carbonation is medium to low with incredible creaminess. Heavy and viscous body coating the palate with a velvety feel.

Wow! This is one of the best barrel aged stouts, if not the best Ive ever had. Its pure bliss. I liked the 2013 better than the 2012 but both were incredible. Highly recommended.

A - Pours a murky with a small head.

S - Smells sour, acidic lacto, mild dusty funk, sharp damp wood, sour orchard fruit, apples, berry tartness, some peppery notes, whiskey soaked wood. The aroma of old furniture woods comes out when warmed up.

T - Puckering sour upfront, acidic fruit, unsweetened cranberry juice, tart cherries, apple skins, lemons, sharp salty cheese, a rounding whiskey and wood slowly sneaks out as it warms. The finish has a snappy pepperness to it, but closes crisp and clean.

M - Sour with an acidic bite, mild effervescent carbonation that smooths out as it sets.

This packs a pretty sour punch. The tartness puckers your taste buds, scrubs the palate bringing with it complex esters, leaving behind light whiskey and old wood. Very nice roundness with crisp and snappy finish. I wish I would have bought more.

M - Medium full body, foamy carbonation, finishes crisp with a rounded woody bitterness. The alcohol becomes sharp when allowed to warm up.

Excellent aroma. The wood doesnt stand out but is layered underneath the fruit and malt. Theres noticeable bitterness that almost clashes with the alcohol. It would get in the way if it were any stronger but really helps with the sweetness. Pretty good for an American made Quad.

The cookie dough malt is sweet and buttery with coconut and vanilla lightly grazing the edges. Candied pears come out as it warms. Finishes clean with vanilla and sweet maple/whiskey.

M - The wheat creates a thick and creamy body that is welcomed. Creamy whipped carbonation with a smooth, chewy, and full feel but the alcohol creates some sharpness. Very creamy but sharp at times.

One of the best smelling beers Ive had the opportunity to sniff. Its sweet, buttery, creamy, savory whiskey filled beer with a full bodied and underlying wheat base. The alcohol is there but is mostly kept in check by the wheat malts. My first Wheat wine aged on barrels. This is worth seeking out.

A - Pours black with a thin mocha cap. The head settles down and vanishes while leaving thick legs down the glass.

S - Massive roasted malt aroma, rich bready malts, Amish chocolate bread, caramel/chocolate, big nutty yeast, toasted coconut, vanilla, toasted graham crackers, cherries and other dark fruits come out as it warms.

T - Roasted barley, sweetened espresso, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, nutty brown bread, strong coffee flavored with coconut syrup. The bourbon is light but rustic with a scorched butterscotch character. Dark fruit emerges as it warms. The alcohol

M - Medium full body when cold but once warm turns to light side of medium body, thin but silky feel, the consistency becomes more syrupy as it warms. Warming finish with some bite.

A big and bold flavored beer that is far from boring. The yeast was very strong and nutty creating a very bready flavor, which was a nice change for a RIS. I liked this one colder rather than warm. Once this warms up it becomes a thin syrupy alcohol bomb. The bourbon was there but delicate and didnt overpower the hefty malt bill. Nice fruit components but its hard to distinguish the type of fruits. Glad I got to try this one.

A - Pours pitch black with a micro bubbled mocha head. Smooth lacing left behind.

S - Roasted malts and bakers chocolate jump right out. Sweet but savory. The wine barrel is very present. Woody red wine, and raspberry aroma, some smokiness. The malts overtake the wine barrels as it warms up.

T - A vinous tartness wakes up the palate. Pinot noir, raspberries, cranberries, woody tannins, tangy fruit, the roasted chocolate malts stay underneath the acidic fruit/wine notes. As it warms the chocolate comes out more and almost pairs with the wine character, but when room temp the roast seems to clash with the acidity of the fruit. Finishes tart and dry.

M - Medium body, kinda on the thin side, carbonation is low but creamy,

This was a fun one to drink. I havent found a wine barrel stou that Ive fallen in love with yet. This comes close though. Theres a small window of temperature were the flavors work pretty well together but before and after that window its not exactly harmony. Its not bad just not great. The nose is very enticing and gives notions of minor tartness but the flavor is more tart than I was expecting. I love the wine component but Im not in love with the combining efforts. Glad I tried this and am anxious to see how my other bottle turns out in a couple of years.

Vintage 2012 Anniversary!

A - Pours a hazy garnet amber with a yellowish sudsy head. The head forms a razor thin cap with speckled lacing left on the glass.

S - Candied barley, sweet citrus, caramel, toffee, bourbon barrel, spicy grains, maple syrup, orange alcohol.

T - Thick toffee malt, spicy barley, orange cream, confectioners sugar, maple syrup, honey drenched grain, grapefruit rind, the citrus hops provide good flavor and medium bitterness against this heavy handed malt. Notes of bourbon soaked wood, a peppery spicyness becomes more pronounced as it warms. The spicyness comes from the alcohol but seems to trick the palate into thinking its from a spicy grain. Finishes malty, spicy and slightly bitter.

M - Thick syrupy body, low creamy carbonation. Fuller body for the ABV. Gets slicker as it warms.

This is big all around. It still has a good amount of grapefruit hops which it needs to combat all that sweet malt. I like this better now than when I had it 4 months ago for some strange reason. As sweet and as high as this ABV is, I found my self talking bigger drinks. This beer is very smooth and for the amount of malt this puppy packs there is a good supporting cast with the wood and hops. Ive had beers in this ABV range and most cant pull it off. This one does.

I wouldnt set on this one too much longer. The remaining hops are what saves this beer from being an ultra sweet diabetes overload. Drink it now.

On tap in Alpena Michigan. Review from notes

A - Black body, with 1 finger of creamy tan head.

S - Coffee, creamy chocolate, roasted malts, dark bread, yeasty

T - Follows the nose with creamy chocolate, cold coffee, roasted and roasted malts. Hops are there to support but stay in the shadows of the chocolate and coffee duo. The chocolate turns to to a more bitter bakers chocolate toward the dry finish.

M - Very creamy feel, lushes sudsy carbonation, dry bitter finish.

My 1st beer from Great Lakes and it will not be my last. Theres not alot going on, the chocolate and coffee are the stars and the are showcased very well.

750ml corked and caged bottle served in a snifter
Bottled on: 06/22/12

A - Pours dark mahogany with 2 fingers of whipped mocha head. The sinks into a nice collar with a whispy cap. Lacing is sticky and speckled.

S - Glorious melted toffee/caramel on top of copious amounts of toasted barley. Wood vanilla, bourbon, rich and sweet, dates, raisins. Sweet whiskey alcohol comes out when allowed to warm. As soon as I popped the cork hops jumped right out but then faded after the pour.

T - Spicy bitterness upfront, dry wood comes in strong, heavily toasted barley, toffee, caramel, pine hops, spicy, charred raisins, vanilla, ginger, pine hops continue to build, melding with the alcohol for a spicy dry finish.

M - Full bodied, chewy, low to medium carbonation, dry astringent finish.

Amazing aroma. I could smell this beer all day. This beer is almost 1.5 years old and still has quit a bit of hop presence. More in the flavor than the nose. The alcohol is spicy and somewhat mild except for the finish, which is little harsh. Glad I set on this for awhile.

Batch-1 May 2013

A - This beer is cloudy with a golden pale color, a massive rocky white head slowly settles with cavernous mounds of bubbles. Sloppy wet lacing sinks down the sides of the glass.

S - Grain dust, earthy hay, grainy pilsner malts, lemons and minerals, the yeast is tangy and bready with a very mild funk and timid white pepper phenolics. Mushrooms come out once it warms up.

T - Tangy lemons, mineral soda water, slightly acidic, the dusty hay and grassiness fade quickly as it warms. Bright tropical fruits work well against the grainy pale malt. Lemony tang really comes around on the backend along with a floral/herbal bitterness finishing crisp and clean.

M - Active seltzer-like carbonation, light body, crisp and clean.

Bright, dry, and very refreshing. A very nice Saison indeed. Extremely crisp with mineral water and tangy lemon taking the stage. I am thoroughly enjoying this beer on a brisk 28 degree November night.

Thanks to Hopswagger for this one.
Bottled June 2012

A - Super cloudy, tawny orange/brown color. 2 fingers of yellow head fizzle down forming a thin cap. Zero lacing.
Opened this one over the sink and Im glad I did. Popped the top and out came gushing bubbles.

S - Big brett aroma, citrus and cherries, tart and sweet, tropical fruits, mango, pineapple but mostly papaya. I mean like you cut open a papaya and stuck your nose in it. Theres a strong layer of wine soaked wood along. Some cherry bubblegum and mineral notes in the background along with some lactose sugar.

T - Tart fruit upfront, cherries, grapes, lemons, very seltzer like. Stings the tongue. Then it transitions into some sweet and fruity malts in the middle, orange citrus, some bubblegum, semi tart candy but quickly turning dry again. The wine barrel rolls in bringing in old vinous wood, dried tropical fruits, vinous basement funk, earthiness, dry with an refreshing finish.

M - Effervescent bubbles upfront, very dry in the middle but the dryness drops off a tad on the finish. The carbonation is overbearing the first pour but drops of as it sets. Medium wet body but full carbonation. Weird mouthfeel.

Awesome bretty aroma full of tropical and vinous fruit. The barrel was milder in the flavor but added plenty depth. The mouthfeel is weird and hard to explain. This bottle is almost 1.5 years old and Ive never had it fresh so I cant tell if its gotten better or worse but its drinking great.

Review from notes:

A - Dark reddish brown with ruby hues on the edges, hazy with a small sudsy cap. Good lacing.

S - Strong caramel malt, tangy dark fruit, earthy hops, pine mostly.

T - Follows the nose with dark caramel malt, fruity alcohol, the fruit is generic and hard to pick out, earthy rugged flavors, pine/herbal hops. Finishes semi-dry with some alcohol and pine.

M - Medium full body, medium carbonation, alcohol shows up a bit, sweet semi-dry finish.

A malty strong ale the has enough hops to balance it out. Plenty of alcohol showing but works well with all components. Glad I had a chance to try this.

A - Pours black with brown hued edges, a thick 2 fingered head stands tall and frothy. The glass stays coated with mocha lacing and the head shows impressive retention.

S - Roasted malt, leafy green hops, brown bread crust, peppery, toasted rye

T - Sweet roasted malts, creamy chocolate at first then turns slightly scorched, some citrus lurking underneath sharp rye grains, the roast is mild at first but grows along with the rye, and leafy green hops. Its like all the components come together and build growing stronger toward the finish, ultimately choking out all sweetness. Finishes dry with a spicy citrus bitterness.

M - Medium/heavy weight with a fuller body, moderate carbonation, creamy, Lots of hop resin left on the aftertaste.

Great stuff here. I tried to sip it but I found my self drinking this like a session beer. Its a big transition beer from start to finish. Great showcasing of the rye as well. I really enjoyed this brew and will definitely buy again.

A - Pours a cloudy amber orange with an off white sudsy cap that clings to the edges of the glass. Solid sheets of lacing blanket the glass. Very impressive lacing and retention. It doesnt get much better.

S - Bright grapefruit flesh, fresh green leafy hops, hints of peppery spice, earthy pomegranate, orange peel, hints of wood, candy sweetness, hints of golden raisins, some yeast comes out as it sets.

T - The flavor follows the nose with grapefruit flesh, sweet and bitter, bright and vibrant grapefruit with leafy green mixed in. A faint pale malt lingers in the background. Finishes with dominate grapefruit pith, bitter and dry.

M - Medium body, creamy lush feel, medium carbonation, very dry finish

This tastes like the base beer with extreme dryness which could be placed from wood aging. The C hops play very well off the pale malt creating citrus wonderland. World class in terms of looks, while providing a very nice mouthfeel. Wish there was a little more bourbon flavor.

A - Pours black with a small kahki head that vanishes pretty quick. Not a trace of lacing.

S - Fresh cut cedar/pine wood off the initial pour, strong spices, madras curry, cardamom, cumin, black peppercorns, lavender, purfumy.

T - Spices galore, sharp black pepper, cumin, turmeric, madras curry, basil, coriander, theres some chili heat in there as well. Theres a salty sharpness in there that cuts through the spice. With the exception of some roasted malts, the spices basically drive the train taking over any other yeast, malt or hop that could be present. Finishes spicy with a solid dose of chili heat left on the palate.

M - Low carbonation, its thin but heavy liquid, finishes dry and oily with chile heat.

This screams Indian food. If you dont like it, chances are you probably wont like this beer. Its a full on curry spice assault on the palate. Good chili heat as well. The bottle version seems to be hotter in terms of chile spice than on tap. Curry lovers, you have found your beer.

A - A hard pour reveals a thick black liquid forming 1 finger of dark espresso frappa on top. The dark head forms a milky cap with a strong collar speckled lacing weaved around the vertical legs.

S - Rich roasted malts, creamy chocolate, coffee, roasted raisins/dark fruit, charred oats/grain, hickory wood, smells sweet but dry at the same time. Intoxicating aroma.

T - Semi sweet bakers chocolate, malts are roasted and robust, creamy cherries, sweet center with charred molasses, then back to charred oats, smokey, vanilla, notions of dry wood with earthy hop bitterness taking it home to the extremely dry finish.

M - Thick and decadent, as full bodied as they come, the oats really ad some heft here, velvety and creamy feel, coats the mouth, super dry finish.

This is an oatmeal stout! Lots of oat presence added to a stellar base beer with the raisins only showing up in the nose for the most part. Just a big bold stout that hits all the right notes. An excellent brew to celebrate on this International Stout Day!

A - Brassy golden body, crystal clear, firm 2 finger off-white head. Textbook retention and lacing showing off.

S - Awesome bouquet of citrus aroma. Grapefruit, apricot, spicy, light bready malt. Yeast comes out more as it sets. The aroma is spot on. A harmonious balance of hops, yeast and malt.

T - Spicy grapefruit bitterness right off the top. Bright and clean. Sweet and bitter grapefruit flesh morphs into resinous grapefruit rind bitterness toward the end. Citrus, pineapple, and, stone unripened stone fruit dominate the palate. It has a simple sweetness that plays off the hops wonderfully. Semi grainy malts add just enough backbone to support the strong citrus hops. Finishes crisp and clean with a long bitter aftertaste.

M - Medium full body, low to medium carbonation, smooth with a very clean finish.

This might be the best IPA Ive had to date. It is clean, precise, and executed almost flawlessly. Its bursting with hop flavor and bitterness without being over the top which is hard to come by. The layering of flavors are very impressive. As of right now this is my favorite IPA to date. This 6pack was 15.99 but worth every penny.

A - Brilliant pecan brown body with an active off-white head. No lacing and lackluster head make this a single color beer.

S - Big malts, some general hops on the edges, sweet and clean aroma.

T - Caramel malts, bready, sweet, toffee, it has a peppery overtone that creates a nice bite against the string malt base. Fall spices, all spice and nutmeg come to mind. Notions of sweet pumpkin, but that could be a placebo effect. Super sweet with some welcoming alcohol swimming in on the finish.

M - Low to medium carbonation, syrupy body, medium with some minor lift from the carbonation. Could use a touch more carbonation.

This is a malt bomb. Theres almost enough hop edge to combat it. The syrupy elixir provides memories of fall, spicy treats and an overall warmness. You have to know what youre getting into with this beer. Its uber sweet with hints of roundness toward the finish.

S - Chocolate malts, roasted malts, chocolate bread, muddled fruit, sweet cream, chocolate lined alcohol.

T - Creamy milk chocolate upfront, sweet and decadent, heavily roasted malts and strong bitterness come in quickly and overtake the creamy sweetness. The middle provides anise, smoked molasses, and a strong bitterness that runs throughout the drink. The finish brings intense roasted malts, bittering chocolate, notions of fruit, hints of grass and winds up for a smooth and roasted chocolate finish.

M - Incredibly viscous, thick and full bodied. Moderate micro carbonation, dry roasted finish. One of the best mouthfeels Ive come across.

Theres something to be said about being complex in a simple way. This beer is simple but it brings outstanding precision and subtle complexities, with a strong bitterness to round out the sweetness. Very focused flavors that bring maximum flavor with a stellar body that is as creamy as they come. My favorite Bells by far!

Very fresh: Just hit the stores

A - Honey amber with a massive 3 fingers of off-white head with sparkling 3d lacing down the side of the glass.

S - A glass of crushed hop pellets, sharp pine, dirty citrus, hints crackery malts, floral potpourri.

T - Pungent citrus and spicy hops burst on to the palate. Dank green hops just dominate everything in its path. As it warms up, orange and floral notes come out of the generic green hop attack. Sweet orange rind, spearmint, and light caramel undertones come out with notions of alcohol toward the end. The finish is bitter with some some resinous sweetness and perfumey alcohol. Fairly dry for the ABV.

M - Medium body, very bitter, semi astringent, lushy feel, but syrupy at times.

If youve ever chewed on a hop pellet than you know what this beer tastes like. Its just an onslaught of potpourri hops of all kind, just clashing together all at once.

Any novice brewer can dump a truck load of hops in a beer but there is something to be said about brewing a 10.10ABV beer and not coming out with a sweet boozy malt bomb. All said, this is just a hop overload that has no layering or flavor distinction. Congratulations on being the hoppiest DIPA.

Edit: just ordered a West Coast IPA on tap from a local establishment and it tasted so off that I went and told them the taps must be dirty. They told me me they accidentally gave me Green Bullet instead. Talk about a blind taste test!

16.9 floz corked and caged bottle to a Duvel Tulip
No date, purchased early 2013

A - Dirty/cloudy burnt orange, milky off-white head, not extremely pretty but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

S - Fruit puree, bananas, oranges, apricots, pears, apple cider, creamy smelling when cold but becomes more vinous as it warms. Oak is faintly in the background throwing apple and woody aromas. Some acidity aromas become more pronounced as it warms.

T - Fruit overloads the senses, sweet and tangy, more cidery than the nose describes. Spiced apples, lemons, oranges, tangy pears, grapes, peaches. A peppery bitterness runs on the edges and is hard to tell if its coming from hops or alcohol. Theres actually a handful of random spices that I cant even pick out. Oak and vanilla undertones are buried pretty deep beneath the powerful fruit esters. Alcohol bears down pretty hard creating a cloyingly sweet and boozy finish that has some spicy harshness to it.

M - Low effervescent carbonation that stings and prickles when you hold it in your mouth. Full bodied but light weight. The body changes from thick to thinner as it sets.

Smells great but the rest is a different story. Cloying gets thrown around on beer reviews quite a bit, but this...this is cloying. I dont mind alcohol presence but it, mixed with the cloyingly sweet fruit barrage, overpowered the dainty barrel notes I was hoping for. I appreciate trying to make a big beer like this but this just doesnt work for me.

22oz red wax tipped bottle served in a snifter

A - Dark brown with reddish highlights. A strong pour provides a small of-white head that quickly settles into a razor thin cap.

S - Sweet woody bourbon, vanilla, apples, sticky caramel/toffee.

T - Matches the nose with sweet caramel/toffee, slightly charred, sugary bourbon wood with heavy apple fruit. Theres a strong barley note running right down the middle. Some peppery hops are there to combat the sweetness and grow in bitterness toward the finish. Familiar ""Marshall"" tannins start showing up added some nutty English dryness, with strawberries emerging toward the finish. The finish sets up semi-sweet with a quick dryness at the end with alcohol and charred tannins lingering.

M - Chewy at times but overall a very soft feel, low carbonation, medium body, alcohol comes out as it warms.

A sublime aroma with sweet and comforting bourbon laced malts that make you want to inhale slow and deep. The flavors match the sweetness but theres a dryness that keeps things in check. Plenty of barrel there but nothing over the top. Very smooth and full flavored with some minor tannins and alcohol flaws showing up on the finish. Happy 5th Anniversary Marshall!

A - Very dark brown, almost opaque, with a 2 finger kahki head that moves slower than a sloth. Generous amounts of lacing coat over half of one side of the glass.

S - Fresh leafy green hops jump out with bready Belgian notes. Perfume-like roast character, floral hops show up,

T - Spicy green hops, roasted malts, anise, rye, sharp lemon citrus pushes against the roasted toffee malts creating a non-typical flavor profile. Toasted bread crust are acidic fruits, and notes of chocolate malts are showcased in the middle with a sweet center that is surrounded by spicy dryness. A a rush of leafy green and pine hops emerge toward the dry finish leaving a semi resinous feel on the palate.

M - Medium body, ample carbonation, flowy and lush feel,dry finish.

This is an interesting brew. Nice hop profile but the Belgian yeast didnt seem to influence all that much. Above average but nothing mind blowing here.

A - Black liquid with a thin dark drown frappa head that swirls on top.

S - Coffee grinds, cocoa, and vanilla. It says it right on the label but its all very present. The chocolate mixes back and forth between dark and milk chocolate. Smells like a roasted whopper.

T - Intense roasted malts, decadent chocolate infused with chile heat that provides a mild heat and quite a bit of flavor as well. Roasted coffee is there but stays behind the chocolate. Vanilla mixes harmoniously with the coffee and chocolate. Its just the right amount of sweetness. As it warms a smokyness comes out. Finishes malty with roasted bitterness. The chile heats continues long into the finish

M - Moderate micro bubbled carbonation, soft and velvety feel, full bodied and viscous.

I love this beer! I like it better bottled than on tap. An explosion of chocolate and coffee with a chile pepper bite. Whats not to love? Drink this one fresh!!!!

Best before January 2014

A - Crystal clear, dark amber color. A small tan head vanishes before you look at it a 2nd time.

S - Sweet pumpkin, allspice, nutmeg, light cinnamon, undercooked pumpkin bread, creamy. The yeast sets in and bands with the malt, which is becoming sweeter by the second, and starts overtaking the fresh pumpkin and spice I noticed on 1st pour.

T - Creamy pumpkin filling up front with weird berry fruit esters flaring around. Theres a cranberry sweetness (without any tartness). Its pretty sweet and becoming thin as it sets. Generic sweet malt emerges pushing the pumpkin and spices back. Theres no hops to speak of except a notion of very faint herbal bitterness. Finishes with a thin syrupy malt sweetness.

M - Thin wet body but the carbonation helps lift it up a bit at first but drops off about mid glass creating a thin syrupy sweet body with a lackluster finish.

This started off good but quickly transformed into a generic sweet liquid. The carbonation was ample at the start which faded, as did the spices and pumpkin, which ultimately lead to a thin sweet malt bomb. I expected more from Sam Adams. If you drink this beer make sure it is ice cold! Dont let this sucker warm up.

Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass

A - Pours a dark russet brown, with a foamy tan head

S - Oxidized malts, husky grain, light roasted malts, old molasses. The yeast starts coming out as it warms yielding fruit bread dough, prunes, over-ripened berries, wheat germ,

T - Creamy and bready sweetness, muted fruit with a sharp edge. English malts, burnt caramel, tea tannins, and hints of leafy green hops. Plums, berries, thin molasses, very fruity with dark bread malts and bitter tannins rounding out the finish with roasted malts lingering.

M - Straight up medium body with low to medium carbonation, lightly textured with a wet middle and a tannin dry finish.

No doubt this is brewed in England. A very traditional tasting ale with some minor oxidation flaws. But its to be expected from an import. Nice fruit notes with some hops still hanging in there. The yeast really shows up and adds a bready doughy character. Would love to have this on cask in England.

A - Pours cloudy with a glowing burnt orange color. A tall concrete head that just sits there and melts at a very slow pace. Large sheets of lacing coat the inside of the glass.

S - Big Brett bouquet, pungent citrus with layers of earthy funk, a quick swirl brings out potent tropical fruit, pineapple, papaya, mango, lots of dusty grass aromas, spicy, limes, candy malt sweetness, old muted honey grahams.

T - Zesty limes and a multitude of tropical fruits, sharp and acidic as the nose describes, dry and spicy in the middle, with a timid and unsweet tart candy bite, limes continue along with some salty notes. Funk, earth and grass are present but take a backseat to the spiciness and the citrus acidity. A kiss of fruity sweetness emerges right before the dry finish.

M - Soft micro carbonation that stings the tongue, then turns smooth. Medium/full weight but does not deter from the beer.

They did not hold back on the brett for this beer. Its like a roller coaster of aromas and flavors that change by the minute. At first pour its bright and fruity, then it goes to earthy funk, then to spicy and dry, then to grassy, then dusty, and then it foes back through the whole wheel with morphed characteristics.

If you love Brettanomyces, I mean REALLY love it, then this beer is for you.

A - Pours a clear copper with a dense off-white head

S - Sweet bread, caramel, very sweet and bready, tangy fruit, apple, nutty yeasty, hints of alcohol, very British aroma.

T - Hops upfront, grassy with a hint of citrus, caramel malt rushes in providing a full balanced sweetness, notes of toffee and toasted grain as well. Some weird artificial notes come up but are very faint. Hints of apple and creamy vanilla come in giving way to a strong tea tannin bitterness. Grassy and herbal hops sing into the finish. The finish pushes heavy tannins that linger on the palate long after.

M - Low carbonation, medium full body, creamy feel with a tannin dry finish

Great stab at the style. Nice homey caramel malts that showed grain notes with some fruit notions. Everything worked except for the hints of artificial flavors that faintly showed up. Very good but not quite what youd find in the UK. I would pick up a six of this anytime.

Yeast and spice dominate this beer. Not a typical BSPA which is nice. A sturdy malt base brings intentions of strong sweetness but is snuffed out but the dry yeast. Very complex and ever changing through the different temperatures of the drink. Dupont delivered my expectations of this beer.

S - Dark coffee, roasted malts, sweet, almost smokey, hints of sweet vanilla.

T - Decadent roasted malts, sweet coffee, firm bitterness from leafy green hops, vanilla, burnt raisins, thin molasses, residual brown sugars, finish is long and bitter with dark chocolate popping out once warm.

M - Silky and thin but good, creamy but light, low carbonation, bitter finish.

Good stuff here. One of the best beers from this brewery. This would go good with fish and chips as well as a desert beer. Good hop bitterness with a sweet roast to balance it out.
