Im almost inclined to not do this review

A: Dark brown with no lace and almost no lace

S: Sweet and roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dark malts. But it wasnt the strongest aroma for a beer, actually it was kind of faint.

T: Almost the same as the smell, it was watery, astringent leaving a dry mouth (but thats very normal in the few imperials stouts that I had) lacks complexity and flavor, again it was kind of faint.

Overall it was an unimpressive beer, kind of a watered down version of a Yeti, de Molen or Hercule. I will try to have it again in order to see if my beer was wrong.

Palate: heavy mouth feel, lingering coffee taste.

Overall: Its an amazing beer that I would have with my eyes close, but just one peer beer session. Strong at 9.5% but then again delicious. Strongly recommended, craft beer at its best. ",99.947,arturorg,Colorado,9.5%,Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout - Oak Aged

First of all, I had a major gush opening the bottle, then serving the beer I spilled some more in the floor, it gets a huge head when poured so be careful. 

Appearance: It a turbid dark amber with sediments on it, dont get me wrong its a very inviting color.

Aroma: It was a very aromatic beer, just opening the bottle there was a rush of fruity smells straight to your nose, I got hints of peaches, tea and pines.

Palate: it is a full bodied beer, very effervescent, a little bit warming from the alcohol (the alcohol flavor its not overwhelming at all), the aromas are representen in the palate as well.

Overall its a very inviting beer that I will repeat again, very fresh and refreshing as well that leaves you with a good buzz. Recommended    ",98.136,arturorg,Netherlands,9.2%,De Molen Storm & Bliksem

Served into a Heinneken mug

The pour it was a dark brown resembling any cola with a big off white creamy head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a small lacing

The smell (for me) it was overpowered by the malts and coffee with hints of licorice and banana.

The taste (it was awesome), malts, coffee, licorice (also my wife tasted some chocolate that i couldnt), the alcohol taste its very smooth for a 7.1% ABV, I think if you have a couple it can sneak on you. The flavor its not very long lasting the only thing that leaves behind its coffee feel in the mouth.

In all its a very light beer to drink for a dark one with complex flavors, that leaves you wanting more.

I will have more!!!

Honey colored beer with a 2 inch white head that persisted for a minute or so, a little lace afterward. It has a sweet smell also with earth tones (alfalfa?? - dont know if its written this way :-), metallic tones from hops as well, with very long aftertaste that progresses. Very thin sensation in mouth and very high carbonation.

I would drink it again given the opportunity, can easily say that could be one of the best Spanish beers that I had (that its not much to say)
