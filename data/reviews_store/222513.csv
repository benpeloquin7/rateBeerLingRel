The clean, rich toasty malty taste and the aroma are well crafted. It strikes the proper blend or balance. Id categorize it as sweet but not overly so.

During todays college football game watching I sampled 2 cold ones. Ive a lady friend who sampled mine and she was blown away by it also. Another friend of ours then sampled hers when she ordered. Ive not seen such unanimity in a long while about a beer taste. ",58.761,Ragman,Massachusetts,5.3%,Samuel Adams Octoberfest
