Its an outstanding restaurant that makes many of its dishes with Belgian ales as ingredients.  The day I had this was the one sunny day I experienced in Belgium on that trip (out of 7 days total).  The waiter was quite possibly the most knowledgeable Ive ever encountered, regarding food, beer, and food/beer pairings.  De Spinnekopke is a national treasure, and Westvleteren 12 is the best beer in the world! ",,TKingsley,Belgium,10.2%,Westvleteren 12 (XII)
