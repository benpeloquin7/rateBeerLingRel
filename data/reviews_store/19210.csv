Most fruit based beers use a wheat yeast but this beer uses an English ale yeast. This allows the peach to stand out on its own. That said the peach contributes a fruitiness to the beer as opposed to a real peach character as in a peach lambic. The low level of hop (20 ibu) adds just the right level of hop character on the finish. Being a naturally carbonated bottle conditioned beer it certainly had that English style level of carbonation - very un-Australian but refreshingly different. ,4.844,Paul,Australia,5.5%,Mercs Own Peach Ale
