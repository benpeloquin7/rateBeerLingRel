I think it benefits from being drunk at room temperature. No cooling or chilling gives its great aromas the chance to tickle your nose so when you push the beer to the roof of your mouth, the flavour combines with the aroma and makes it a fully rounded satisfying drink. A great, great beer.  ",45.495,D09,England,4.8%,Bankss Fine Fettle (Bottle)
