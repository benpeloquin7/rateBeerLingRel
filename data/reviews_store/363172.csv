The color is a beautiful burgundy with a tan/white head that dissipates fairly quickly. A nice medium body with effervescent carbonation. The taste starts tart and sour but that falls off fairly quickly giving way to the refreshing quality of blackberries, which evolves into a slightly leathery/oaky aftertaste. This beer is complex and fucking delicious.  ",98.244,benjanomyces,North Carolina,8.5%,Wicked Weed Oblivion Sour Red
