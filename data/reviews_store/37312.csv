Lagunitas is one of my new favorite breweries. I think Hop Stupid is my favorite IPA in the world. Second off Ive learned that Kansas is the first state that this beer was released in, which is confusing and amazing since the brewery is in California... but Ill take it. This beer is quite amazing. The aroma is very hoppy and fruity but not the normal floral and citrus notes that you get from IPAs.  The taste is much the same. For the moment that is where I will leave you, Boulevard Dark Truth also came out today and I need to get onto that. ",95.905,blink13,California,7.83%,Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot (WTF) Ale

It just came into the store today. Sadly enough I am drinking this out of Barenjager mug and hiding it below the counter between customers, but I couldnt wait.

Mildly sweet and spicy with a medium slick body and active carbonation and a slightly biting finish. Overall an awesome awesome beer. Rye whiskey in a most joyous form.
