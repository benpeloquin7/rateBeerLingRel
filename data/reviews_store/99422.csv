Pours a dark amber with a moderate head.  Little to no lacing.
Slightly more bitter than sweet.
Light body and oily texture, with soft carbonation and an astringent finish.
I could not recommend this beer to anyone.  To date this is the worst Scotch Ale I have ever tasted.

Pours a copper orange with little head and lacing.
A rather sweet taste without being overwhelming. 
A medium body with little carbonation and a somewhat filmy texture.   Lightly bitter at the end with just a touch of citrusy hops.

Very nice beer.  But maybe not a true representation of a Brown Ale.  I would liken this beer to a hybrid of Brown Ale and a Scotch Ale.  I would definitely buy this again. ",43.33,Butchnut,Georgia,6.5%,Red Brick Ale
