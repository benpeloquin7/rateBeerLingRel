Nice medium head upon first pouring that likes to cling loosely to the side of my glass.  Reminds me of the glorious Celebration ale in terms of hoppiness, only a bit maltier/sweeter.  Not all that fruity, but definite undertones of bittersweet caramel.  Definite alcohol warmth once it descends past the throat. ",99.046,decapitacion,California,9.6%,Sierra Nevada Bigfoot
