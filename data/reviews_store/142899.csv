All of us are beer nerds and we had a mixed reaction to the beer.

I absolutely love it, but its subtle and you have to go in with an open mind.  Layers upon layers of flavors and aromas make this a wonderful beer to drink slowly and savor.  

This is more like a classic drama and less like an action film.  One member of my group didnt care for it much and let me finish his, though I had to fight for it because my girlfriend fell in love with it.  He claimed it was without any distinctive flavor, a claim 3 of us dispute.  The fourth member of the group claimed that the graininess of the wheat was overpowering the subtle tequila essence and that it should have spent more time in the barrel.

My palate might nit be as developed as his, but I know one thing for sure.  This is a delightful beer chalk full of surprises and lingering subtleties.
