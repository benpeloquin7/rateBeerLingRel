I imagine this is a problem with translation: possibly they were looking for the English word for ""Strong Beer"", and someone (unacquainted with the actual product, and naturally thinking of Baltic porter, or Imperial Stout) could have suggested ""stout"". A quick look at an English dictionary would show that ""stout"" could mean ""heavy-bodied"", or ""strong and full of character"". Not realizing that these definitions applied to people and not to styles of beer, the Lithuanian Marketing Dept. went ahead with their label designs... at least thats my guess.

As for the beer? Unremarkable lager aroma. Pours clear golden yellow, not too pale, with a credible if short-lived attempt at a head. An initial malty fruitiness soon gives way to a yeasty sugar-syrup flavor. The hops fight valiantly to dry things out a little, but to no avail: the end notes are almost cloyingly sweet.
