At 5.8 ABV this makes a eventfull session beer. The bottled version needs to be gently inverted to mix in the yeast before opening and pouring. Slight banana esters and spicy POR hops temp the nose. The body is a little thin if the bottle is not inverted prior to pouring. The fluffy head disappears but laces the glass as you refresh yourself. The slight bitter finsh balances the sweetness. The draft version lacks the bottling yeast and can be a little thinner.  ,38.946,nonicman,Australia,5.8%,Coopers Sparkling Ale
