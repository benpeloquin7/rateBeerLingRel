Molasses, carob and vinous qualities are strongly present.  Some odd astringency is noticed as well.  Some oxidation.  Finish is meh.  Too dry, without the rich, encompassing body that I was hoping for.

I really wish I had tried this fresh.  The bottle we opened was a let down.  Not horrid, but not great.  Maybe the age, maybe the specific bottle, maybe just the beer itself.  

Still, Im really happy I got to try this - Id been looking for this for a long time as a huge fan of Shorts, so this was definitely one of my white whales.  Thanks again Carlos! ",97.262,rallison,Michigan,12.5%,Shorts Mystery Stout (12.5%)

Big red wine flavors against a fruity, sour base.  Tart.  Nice wheat component to smooth things out a bit.  Lively.  Slight raspberry notes.  Caramel notes.

Very good, and quite interesting to have this side by side with the base beer (BeeSting).

Highly recommended. ",99.63,rallison,Pennsylvania,7%,Bullfrog Beekeeper

Very fruity with notes of dates, dried fruits, caramel and similar aromas.  Definitely some Belgian yeast esters coming out here.  Raisins.  Apples.

Lots of fruity caramel in the taste.  Apple notes.  Brown sugar.  Raisin.  Pleasant.

Mouthfeel is not cloying, but has a nice richness accentuated by a slightly sticky caramel quality.  Nice.

Well done.  

Interesting, fruity, Belgian take on a Scotch ale.  Not amazing, but I enjoyed it. ",91.638,rallison,North Carolina,9%,French Broad Wee-Heavy-est Belgian Scotch Ale

Thanks durhambeer for this nice bonus!

Pours a dark brown/black color with minimal head and subdued carbonation.

Smells of carob, dark fruits and touches of dark chocolate. 

Taste is actually quite pleasant. Lots of dark berries and molasses with minimal roast and a nice, dark chocolate backbone that mingles with the berries. Slightly fruity all in all.  Pleasant vanilla presence.  Bourbon character is quite restrained, and the barrels simply add a pleasant vinous quality.

Body is slightly think from the barrel aging, but the low carbonation helps to keep this from being a big issue. I prefer a richer, creamier body for this sort of beer, but I am not disappointed either.

Drinkability is very good.

Recommended. Schlafly is not often my favorite brewery, but this was a nice effort. Give it a try. ",98.459,rallison,Missouri,10.5%,Schlafly Reserve Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout

Apple, cider, cinnamon (this was likened appropriately to cinnamon apple pie)..fruity notes.  A bit of funk and a bit of vinous qualities.

High carbonation and light on the tongue.

Interesting, not what I was expecting, but also not overly impressed, especially given the rarity.
