Rich, golden aura with robust carbonation and active top. Slightly cloudy but colorful and rich.

AROMA: 
Heavy malt and grain true to the bock signature. Slightly sweet but very earthy and deep.

TASTE: 
Walks, talks and carries the bock title proudly. Just enough caramel malt to produce the sweetness that makes this a great Spring beer. Finishes nicely with a molasses high note.

Nicely done American Maibock that delivers everything youd expect from Spring.

Rich, dark and cloudy malt with light carbonation out of bottle into Tulip glass.

AROMA: 
Syrupy malt with a slight lingering smell of dark candy. Narrow range but robust.

TASTE: 
Immediate tangy hit from the sugar covers up flavors underneath, but recovers nicely as it comes in contact as you begin to gulp it down.

Overall an above average altbier that is enjoyable but lacking the promise of flavor it hints at times.

APPEARANCE: 
Cloudy with a rich foam layer and fine lacing in a Tulip Glass. Boils with each swirl and remains lively with each subsequent glass from the growerl.

AROMA: 
Rich, green and hoppy upfront leaving a mix of organic, earthy apple crisp in the nose. Fresh, clean and bold but with consistent lasting power that reminds you of the first snowfall in a pine forest.

TASTE: 
Immediately hits the taste buds with a tannic powerful hop rush then washes through to finish with a slight touch of residual sweetness. 86 IBUs are laced throughout the tasting, but dovetail nicely into a high, pleasant slightly citrus finish that leaves you craving for the next one.

Overall this new discover is an extremely well balanced liberally hopped IPA that rates with some of the best that Vermont has to offer.
