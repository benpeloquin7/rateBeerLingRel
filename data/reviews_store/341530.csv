It takes all of the aromas of a fresh hop cone and puts em in a glass. It pours a deep orange, almost brown with a fairly thick cap of foam that subsides quickly. The aroma is of American hops, though I get more of the citrus and spice than the tropical fruit. The alcohol its very present on the nose and I feel like its masking some of the subtler aromas. On the palette I get burnt sugar and dried fruit sitting on top of a ton of sweetness. But the real star of the show here is the taste of a handful of hop cones on your mouth. Might not be something Id want to drink too often, but itd absolutely a beer that accomplishes what it set out to do - an excercise in hops.
