Thicker and coating with good carbonation. 
Overall: Really nice Imperial Stout with a number of different aromas and flavours. This one has some subtle nuances and the aromas and flavours become more pronounced as it warms. ",99.312,HopsandBolts,Delaware,9%,Dogfish Head Bitches Brew

Charcoal, bourbon, dark malt, molasses, nuts and a bit of a funky barnyard smell.

Overall: Enjoyable Porter overall with lots going on. I really liked the complex aromas and that hint of what I can only describe as ""funky barnyard"" to borrow some wine descriptors. The only thing I wasnt that keen on was it was a bit thinner. ",92.331,HopsandBolts,Canada,7%,Pit-Caribou Robust Tennessee

Overall: A luscious Barley Wine with gobs of honey on the aroma and in the flavour. This shifts towards caramel and honey after it had been open a while.
