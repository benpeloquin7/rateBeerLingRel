Light aroma of tropical fruits, typical of this style, but lighter than expected. Pours a hazy light orange with thin white head. Taste was a very subtle mix of mango and pineapple with hint of citrus hops, fairly light body for a beer of this strength but with a bitter finish.

The taste is very similar with a big big bitter hit of grapefruit, Bam! Soft carbonation just helps with the fizzy citrus palate and full on hops. Bitter finish leaving a linging laste of grapefruit in your mouth. if you are a fan of big citrusy, hoppy beers then this is for you. like an adult, alcoholic version of Ting!!

Mixture of grassy, herby tastes with a hint of muskyness. aftertaste was quite piney. different but in a fairly good way, but my least favorite from the four pack.
