Why?  I got bored to be honest - at some point its just ticking rather than love of the beverage and I had to stop despite numerous beers I had already rated, but never entered.  Its just not fair, and I can only drink for enjoyment....but this is an exception as its my last real unrated gem in the cellar.  Nice burnt orange/brown color with no head.  Aroma of thick Grade B maple syrup, brown sugar, cereal, caramel, and confectionary sugar.  Flavor is solid maple syrup, tawny port (with a good deal of alcohol), burnt/carmelized apples, brown sugar, and plenty of sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is really nice, but peters out a bit towards the end.  Overall a fantastic beverage, worthy of critical acclaim.  A real shame this was never made again, but thats what makes it special.  Rating was fun - had a real blast, but enjoying a good beer without too much thought is far better.  Ratebeer still rules - glad to have contributed a few.
