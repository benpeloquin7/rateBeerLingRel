I hope they bring it back because it was my favorite new beer of 2013, and my favorite IIPA of the year, and my favorite 3 Floyds beer ever... although the artwork was a bit over the top.

It poured a nice golden/orange color with a bit of haze and just the right head. Tons of citrus and stone fruit in the aroma and the taste followed suit. The flavors matched almost perfectly with the aroma. Nice medium body, and a great malt/hop balance - not too much caramel or bitterness - great malt with near perfect hop profile.
