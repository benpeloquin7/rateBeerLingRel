Has subtle wheat notes, a bit fruity, but the hops really kick in for an intense finish.  I think the hops variety that is used should be altered to something more palatable.  The finish is reminiscent of a melted plastic taste.  Other hop varieties contribute great IBUs without tasting ridiculous.  With a different kind of hops, this beer could really be outstanding.
