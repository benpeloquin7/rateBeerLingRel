Light color for amber ale. Aroma is malty/bready with some toast highlights. No hops or esters. Alcohol is quite evident for a 7.1%abv beer. Flavor is lightly toasty with no hop flavor. Finish is dry from alcohol. Cleanly fermented. Medium body and carbonation. Alcohol is far to dominating as a flavor characteristic. Bittering just keeps it from being sweet. ,15.917,brewer2,California,7.1%,Fat Weasel Ale
