Has that classic budweiser look in the glass. I went to the cigar city taste room and they were testing two different lagers to take over for the hotter than helles lager. If this is the replacement I dont like it as much. It isnt bad though. Probably the lightest beer i have had from cigar city. Not bad, but definitely not on par with some of the other amazing cigar city beers.  ",63.855,asb06c,Florida,4.5%,Cigar City Tampa-Style Lager

Pours a reddish amber. Looks great in a pint glass. Thin head that doesnt last long. Defintely a bold beer. Strong bitter taste right off the bat with a nice bitter finish. Like i said.

I think it looks amazing out of the can. It might be one of the best looking beers ive had. Reminds of the way Boddingtons pours into the glass. Tastes below average. Smells like nothing. It isnt an IPA. My guess is that they slapped IPA on the can for marketing purposes. That said, it isnt that bad. Totally drinkable but i probably wouldnt buy it again.

Pours a pretty golden caramel color with a nice fluffy head. The head stick with the beer untul the last sip. Tastes hoppy with a lot of citrus. Has a delicious bitter aftertaste that will have you craving another pint. I highly recommend finding Jai Alai on tap if you are in Tampa. Otherwise a can will work just fine. I find that a lot of the great IPAs out there are tough to drink beyond one or two, but i end up drinking the whole sixer with Jai Alai. Cheers.
