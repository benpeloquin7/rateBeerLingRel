I could pick up very little aroma. The appearance was about right for a Pilsener. It had a grassy flavor that was pleasing to the palate and finished with a lasting hoppy taste that created a desire to repeat. Overall I found this beer very enjoyable and recommend it. ,89.183,LagerSlogger,Louisiana,5%,Abita 20th Anniversary Pilsner

It has excellent color but I prefer a more hoppy lager with a stonger aroma and flavor. It starts out and finishes smooth with moderate flavor. There was not a noticeable change as it travels across the tongue and it finishes with a mild to moderate impact. ,68.995,LagerSlogger,California,4.9%,Anchor Steam Beer
