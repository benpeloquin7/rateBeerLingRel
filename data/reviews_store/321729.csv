Appearance - Pours pitch black with a thin but lasting cream head. Aroma is sweet, malty, fruitcake and caramel with some balsamic vinegar. Taste starts sweet malt and coffee/chocolate then moves quickly to sweet & sour, tangy soy sauce, ends in longish dry finish. Surprisingly light for IRS. Mouthfeel is similarly light with low/medium carbonation. Not bad but I prefer my Imperial Stouts to be fuller, roastier and with a touch more kick.
