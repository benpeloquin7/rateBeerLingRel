From Bottle
Very sour and undrinkable, but alchohol is very evident. Must have been mishandled somewhere along the line. ",97.647,cgras13,Delaware,15%,Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine

Had to take it back to the LQ and get a refund. Most sour nasty beer I have ever tried. The Store I purchased from has good knowledge on celleraring.
Quite sure from reading the reviews that this beer is not intended to taste that way.
