1-finger light-tan head rests atop a clear reddish-brown body. Minimal lace, head dissipates quickly. Nutty, toffee, caramel aromas and flavors. Oats and reams of office paper also come across the nose. Reminds me a lot of Cigar City Maduro, but lighter in body and alcohol comes through more easily. Prickly carbonation. Hops are a little more pronounced as it warms and the beer leaves a dry, slightly metallic finish with a faint hint of pepper and raisin.

Overall I do enjoy this beer (second time having it) but Im more eager to try Coffee Bender. Maduro is one of my go-to beers here in FL and like I said, this reminds me of it, but I dont know if Id drink it as often were I living in MN. ",96.136,brewkkake,Minnesota,5.1%,Surly Bender

Bonita Applebum is, simply put, dessert in a glass. All the familiar aromas and spices of apple pie - cinnamon, nutmeg, buttery crust, apple (obviously), along with just the right amount of alcohol. The slight apple tartness plays well with the spice and a low-key sweetness and its all reminiscent of caramel apple pie. Theyd be insane not to eventually offer this as a float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but the beer itself needs no improvement. The only downside to me is that apple-cinnamon is not my favorite flavor profile so its not as easy for me to drink more than one glass like I would with many of their other beers. The geniuses at Funky Buddha have received national attention for their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter and No Crusts PB&J; ale, and Bonita should be the next huge hit.
