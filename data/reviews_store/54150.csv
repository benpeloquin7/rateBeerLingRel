In the realm of major breweries this little ale takes the gold. Not really a "" Brown ale"" but close enough.Its nuuty flavour and good nose combined with a clean and easy palate. On a hot day its almost medicine. On A side note it makes a great shanty. If your hot a tired pour a newcastle in a large glass and top it off with lemonade. It will recharge you to finnish the day.
