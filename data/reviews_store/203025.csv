You understand the aroma better after you take a taste.  Holy roasted coffee beans....  It&apos;s an amazing follow-through and finish on this beer, but up front it&apos;s too heavy on the burnt coffee bean flavor, IMO.

Dominated by sweet malt, hops barely in the background with such a domination by the maltiness, and an almost burnt TOFFEE taste.  Not that you taste smoke or burning, and not that its bad, but it&apos;s that powerful

This thing is great, but it&apos;s a lot of flavor.  Honestly when I first had it, I couldn&apos;t handle the heavy sweet malt combined with the dry hop.  But glad I waited to review as I&apos;ve come around - this thing is really interesting.  Sweet toffee, a dry hops, and a heavy malt dominate the flavor.  The hoppiness has a quality that&apos;s almost like liquorice.  It&apos;s such a unique flavor I&apos;m almost at a loss for words

Nose is faint wheat and a faint light sour.  Pleasant, but not much do it and perhaps a trace of smoke although if I wasn&apos;t told the style I may not have even caught it. 

Pours a dark hazy orange with light film and bits of lace. Appearance is more like a iambic than a wheat beer.  I know it adheres to purity law - assume this is what all looked like?

Taste is light smoke and nice tart wheat.  This is a really tasty beer, but the flavor comes and goes.  I will say a lot of smoke beers almost linger too long.  This leaves ya with a tiny bit of smoke...

Can&apos;t believe I let this sit in fridge since the summer months.  This would be freaking awesome with a non-greasy grilled dish.  Grilled Gouda burger during the summer? Call me the match maker

Have had in possession for a few months.  It&apos;s time.  Removed the cork which gave a fantastic pop.  Poured aggressively which produced a soapy, carbonated head the likes of which I haven&apos;t seen in awhile.   The bright white, wet, champagne head settled to a light coat, with minimal lace.  Color is slightly cloudy / light orange.  A shade lighter would be nice.

Nose is sour punch, a touch of orange, and some must & earth. 

The first thing that hits me is the bright mouthfeel with some light sour funk and pleasant citrus.  The follow through in taste is a bit lacking, but it&apos;s not bad.  A nice dry, fruity, champagne like after-taste that doesn&apos;t linger.  The lingering is often what I like about this style, and I don&apos;t get it here.  I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s sugar or yeast, but I feel like my teeth are coated.

If there are ""big"" beers, then this is a ""small"" gueuze. But that isn&apos;t a bad thing per se.  I like this and it improved with each sip

Had this few times now, but first time rating.

A touch lighter hue than I like in quads, but a rich amber nonetheless.  Decent  foamy head that lasts. 

Nose is fig and candied brown sugar.  Touch of spice, touch of booze

Taste is a refined hit of spice and dark fruit with an ample dose of sweetness.  Creamy mouthfeel with just a bit of the bready malt that I love.  Perhaps the sweetness is a bit forced for this style (although I still enjoy it). It doesn&apos;t feel as full, complex, big, or ""bready"" as other quads.  But I LOVE this style at the moment so I&apos;m being hyper critical.  I&apos;d buy this again -  it&apos;s very nicely done being such an affordable quad brewed in the US

I&apos;ve been trying to save this one, but I can&apos;t wait til Xmas....apparently the 09 batch is fantastic so it&apos;s aged enough!

Bottle was a gusher.  First ive had like this, really.  Poured into Duvel tulip.  Thick (as expected) head with nice tan color, and the beer is as dark brown as can be without being black.  Love the look

Smell is cherry and Brett.  Not expected but getting excited.  Notes of bready malt underneath.  I poured a bit cold so more fragrance likely to come

Taste: solid.  It&apos;s light sour cherries and dark fruit on top, and the amazing taste of chocolate and toffee underneath, with notes of the bready malt somewhere in there as well.  Sour on the lips and chocolate in the aftertaste 

This is super interesting beer unlike anything I&apos;ve had.  I love belgian strongs and all the taste that comes with it, and i love wild ales.  What an interesting blend of the two

Poured after long day outside.  Eating and drinking earlier...so not best palate

Dark brown, cloudy.  foamy head of dark cream that takes awhile to settle.  Like the look 

Not too much on nose, but malt, rye, and candied sugar come through.

First time in this style, but I dig it!  Low-ish alcohol and not sure what I was expecting, but this is not a &apos;big&apos; beer, but it really doesn&apos;t need to be.  Tiny bit sour, tiny bit dry- not as much sweetness as on nose.    Rye bitterness is there but it&apos;s pleasant.  Though aftertaste perhaps a touch too dry and bitter

Never been a fan of brown ales, and this is certainly very different.  Don&apos;t need more than one, but it&apos;s tasty.  Would have again.

Nose is incredible.  Delicate sweetness, with lemon, honey, pepper, and a touch of coriander.  Fresh.  The sort of nose that I think is outstanding year round.  This is first time I&apos;ve had it so will report back this winter

This beer rocks.  The spice, citrus, vanilla, and honey hits ya all at once, and the combination makes for one refreshing sensation.   When I swallow I get a hint of peppermint and outright pepper as well.   The mouthfeel is smooth and fuller than I&apos;d expect.

Pours a dark gold with just a slight haze.  Half a finger of tan foamy head that quickly fades.  Nose is of sweet malt and bright hops, but to me the malt hits ya first.  Taste follows the aroma quite closely, and boy is it refreshing.  You definitely feel the malty burn, and the hops don&apos;t hit you that hard, so I can&apos;t see not everyone loving the balance, but it will always be refreshing!  Sweet aftertaste with a a nice dryness and it&apos;s only the dryness that lingers.  I tend to like a bit more of the hops to linger...  It&apos;s a really nice beer though, and will always be a staple because of different is.  I am always down for a sixer!

Pours a cloudy gold with excellent thick head which slowly settles to a finger, and nice lacing. Spicey, refreshing hops on the nose. Taste is beautifully refreshing hoppiness but with less of the spice I was expecting in the taste. The finish is dry and refreshing, but again, there isnt any of the funk or the zing I was expecting? Its a very tasty beer, but leaves a little to be desired, particularly in this style. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone ",98.352,DRBiser,Missouri,8.5%,Boulevard Smokestack Series - Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale

Served out of a can while watching the UEFA Euros tournament, poured into my Chimay goblet.  Thin head which quickly dissipates into light film - does not seem highly carbonated.  Color is slightly cloudy amber brown.  Smell is crystal-sweet with only hints of the malty dough smell I was expecting.  Taste is pleasant (without a doubt the tastiest canned beer I&apos;ve had).  First thing I noticed was the light mouthfeel and sweetness of the beer, which I wasn&apos;t expecting...and while this isn&apos;t a bad thing, it felt like the beer didn&apos;t have a lot of size to it.  However, as I let it sit, I could taste the malty chewiness through the sugars, and it was delightful.  Hints of caramel.  And while I&apos;m emphasizing how sweet the beer is, it&apos;s not overbearing.  It&apos;s actually pretty damn good.  Will have again, and would be nice with food.

Foamy head and nice lacing around the glass that holds (though too cold at first).  Not much on the nose - refreshing funk with a touch of lemon grass and perhaps a touch of wheat and sugar.  Taste: sourness off the bat.  Really nice tart profile but not a lot that follows it?  Again, perhaps too cold at first.  The tartness of a lambic but no body or follow-through, and the refreshing scents of a farmhouse saison.  A small dose of dryness after the swallow

I really appreciate this beer. Its super refreshing (especially if you dig sourness), but it could have a bit more character. if Im in the mood for a refreshing tart summer funk, I will revisit.
