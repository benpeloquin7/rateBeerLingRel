Much better on tap! Very nice aroma, what you would expect of a pilsner.  Golden colour with a nice head that lasted throughout.  A hint of bitterness at the end, very easy drinking beer.  One of my favorite Pilsners and I am an Abbey Dubbel guy. ",22.458,MatthewBondy,Canada,5%,Steam Whistle Pilsner
