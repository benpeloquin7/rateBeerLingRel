The aroma is what you would expect from a DIPA, it starts off with extreme floral notes with some citrus added.  The taste is bitter but has enough malt to create an incredible balance.  The taste paired with the creamy texture and long finish create possibly my favorite DIPA. ",,gummyworm,Pennsylvania,10%,Iron Hill Perfect 10
