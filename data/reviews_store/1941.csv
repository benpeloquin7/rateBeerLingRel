More popular than water in Holland because of its richness and poundability.  Wont resort to the bottled taste of the imported Heinekens avaiable in the states anymore.  Not even the keg cans come close to the fresh full taste of the domestic version of Heineken. ,4.552,Snow Belt Bronco99,Netherlands,5%,Heineken
