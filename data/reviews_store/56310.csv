Wow, the tropical fruit aromas that I get from this beer are nothing short of awesome. So much pineapple and mango notes, tangerines, and then some nicely bitter grapefruit and pine needles in the background with some cotton candy and caramel. The flavor has a bit of an added grassy hoppiness, and the tropical flavors dont quite jump out at me as much as they had in the aroma. The cotton candy and caramel malts meld with the hops very well in that I get ""sweet hops""--I dont get this very often in beers and I think its great. Semi-dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 3. Light to medium body with the same for carbonation.
