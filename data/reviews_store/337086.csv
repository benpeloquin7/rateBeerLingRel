A: Very nice looking bright crystal clear medium yellow with an inch of fluffy head atop and bubbles busily rising.
S: Malty, grainy smell without most of the skunk others have mentioned. Slight earthy hop note, so maybe thats it. Not much smell overall but nothing bad.
T: Crisp crackery malt taste with again a hit of earthiness. This actually is fairly reminiscent of a euro lager but not in a bad way. I do not taste corn. A little on the watery side but pretty good tasting.
M: Light bodied to the point of being a bit watery but nice bubble scrub makes it refreshing and easy drinking. Very clean finishing as expected.
O: This beer is overall pretty average but has good points. Nothing bad to report unless youre sensitive to earthy (skunky) hints. Not worth seeking but I bought this in a gas station and it was an outstanding choice considering the limited options. Points taken for lack of date coding leave my overall rating below average.

Pilsner glass
A;Poured a hazy dirty amber. Small head is gone quickly. Visible sediment seen in suspension. Not a really pretty beer to look at.
S: Sweet orange is dominant in the light scent.
T: Its citrusy but definitely not sweet. Bitter pith hoppiness is crisp and followed by a bit of cracker at the finish. Not complex but pretty good and bone dry. A slight fruity tartness at the very end of the sip is surprising and a nice bonus.
M: Medium light body with lively carbonation and clean dry finish makes this refreshing and drinkable. Not oily or particularly resinous. A brisk, stiff ale you can knock back all day.
O: This beer smells inviting, tastes refreshing and flavorful, and feels great going down. Just started to see Otter Creek products in my area so Im very pleased to recommend Over Easy to anyone looking for a new light ale. And this sixer is not even very fresh! Ill be buying a lot of this. ",85.549,malvrich,Vermont,4.6%,Otter Creek Over Easy

A: A hard pour yields only 12"" of beige foam that recedes rapidly to a collar and center bubbles. Clear ruby tea tinted brown color.
S: Some light roast and dark fruit on the nose.
T: Tart hops and roasty malt flavor. Neither cloyingly sweet nor burnt tasting.
Not very complex or heavy. 
M: Smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel with light to medium body. Wet and medium to long coating finish.
O: Tasty and drinkable, this is a very approachable dark lager. Always a bit expensive in my area though at 10.50/6. I like it and will continue to buy from time to time. ",73.695,malvrich,North Carolina,5.1%,Mother Earth Dark Cloud

Chalice glass.
A: Crystal clear medium gold color with some a bubbles visible. Little head from the gentle pour but good sheets of lace.
S: Nice light grassy smell of hay and light toast.
T: Good balance of sharp sour bread balanced by mildly bitter herbal hop notes. Crisp and clean even if fairly nondeScript.
M: Light and crisp with a nice bite and a clean, dry bitter finish. Maybe a tad watery though.
O: Its no Noble Pils and not even a great replacement for it, but it is a serviceable pils, which will be widely available and competitively priced so sure, its worth an occasional purchase if you like the style.

A:Medium gold with a slight haze. Pours a finger high head of puffy cloud texture. Retains fairly well for a few minutes with good thick patches of lace. Small number of lazy bubbles seen.
S: Nice but light grassy, slightly lemony scent, Maybe a hint of alcohol as it warms but not grainy or malty to me.
T: Some booze detected early in the taste. Along with that lemony tartness from the nose. Malty as well for sure but I wouldnt call it sweet. Pretty well balanced and good. Tastes a bit stronger than it is. 
M: Medium to heavy feel for its strength with just enough tingle to keep it interesting. Clean though not exactly dry finish without much resin. Substantial beer.
O: Pretty good pils but more along the lines of a German IMO. Also, I dont necessarily find this a refreshing beer which is what I expect a pilsner to be since the smell is the only thing light about this. This will likely appeal greatly to those who like the taste of pilsners but want a bit stronger, heavier brew. Again, pretty good product overall and worth buying.

A: 1"" tall coarse head lingers for several minutes atop a clear pale orange body. A little lacing in patches.

T: Crisp sweetness from the malts combine with piney but round bitterness with citrus zest ending the finish.
