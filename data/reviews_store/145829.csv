Impressive bottle.  Honey malt aroma and flavor with very little to no hop aroma or bittering.  Sweet malt-liquor finish, not overtly cloying.

Im told, its typical, even good, for a Chinese-style lager, as served in China.  -Source... my Chinese in-laws.

Ill call it good, and it will fill the hole in someones palate, even mine on certain occasions.  And I might even be back to it several times.  Just not a beer I would drink every day.  Try it... youll do your best to find something wrong with it... ",2.206,edgeofblade,Australia,4.8%,Lucky Beer (Lucky Buddha)
