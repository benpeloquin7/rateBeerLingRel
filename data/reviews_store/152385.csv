The texture reminds me of engine oil. Nice brown head. Great aroma, almost attacking my nose. Smells very roasted notes, coffee, dark chocolate, almonds. I can also smell notes of vanilla, cream and some sweet liquorice. Tastes even better. Heres roasted notes, coffee/espresso, dark chocolate, cocoa and vanilla. Starts sweet but quickly turns to a bitter hopy taste. Awesome beer. Feels like a fist punching your mouth after you swallowed it! ",99.841,Laserapa,Colorado,9.5%,Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout

Im new in the beer world but Ill give it a try! 
The colour is very dark brown, almost black with a light brown head that disappear pretty fast. On the nose theres a fruity sweetness, milk chocolate, candy, roasted bread, notes of liquorice and coffee. In my mouth I can taste chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and some dark bread. Not so creamy and theres not so long taste that I had expected but overall a great beer. Ill probably buy this beer again.  ",94.346,Laserapa,England,6.5%,St Peters Cream Stout
