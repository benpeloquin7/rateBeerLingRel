The color was a cloudy light or pale amber. The aroma was truly the best part of the experience, wafting pleasantly from the glass, easily enjoyed a full foot from the glass. Notes of fruit, mild banana and alcohol, maybe whiskey. There was little carbonation, a bit too flat on the palate so the flavor was a little unbalanced. Floral, light hops and yeasty bread. It concealed the high alcohol content nicely with a mild bitter finish. I was expecting to enjoy this beer more as the other Trappist beers I have tried  thoroughly impressed me, even with their massive reputations, but it is without doubt a well made and high quality beer.

It had a dark chocolate brown color and left a beige, full cream color head with good lacing. It had a strong aroma of wood, thick malt and spice. It was obviously a full flavored beer with flavors of wood, dried fruit, and carmelized sugars, sweeter than expected. It had a stronger alcohol flavor than I expected given its 7.7% but perhaps that has to do with the whiskey barrel aging. A light bitter and hop finish. 
Not as complex as I expected but an excellent beer and one that I would gladly sample again.  ",90.703,jhubeifc,England,7.7%,Fullers Brewers Reserve Limited Edition No 1 Oak Aged Ale Single Malt

Given its reputation, I decided to start with the Chimay Bleue in a 33cl bottle. I was not disappointed. 
It poured a dark and cloudy chocolate/caramel color into the glass and left a creamy head which did not disappear right away, but left an enjoyable froth on the sides of my glass.
It had a much fruitier fragrance than I expected given its strength and color with yeast in for good measure. I actually found my mouth water when i wafted it in.
Again, its flavor surprised me. I have tried my fair share of beer at and over 9% apv and I usually find them overpowering but not this one. It had good dried fruit and bread/grains to the palate with a pleasant malt without the over powering sensation of a high alcohol content. It finished a mild bitter and left me swirling, smelling and sipping until it was done. I did not want to gulp it at all, which in this case was a good thing. 
Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future. I am not, however new to Belgian beers and this is one fine example of a good strong Belgian Ale. Undoubtedly worth a try by anyone who loves beer.

Ive also learned that finding one that is well made is much harder. 
I bought a 1L bottle of Le Ble Dor Weissbier at Jasons Food Market in the basement of the FE21 department store and Im very, very glad that I did. 
I am a big fan of Weissbier in the first place and this one did not disappoint. The aroma does not jump out at you. It is subtle and almost as smooth as the first sip you take. The usual weissbier traits are there, banana and sweet fruit. Being fresh beer the product can vary but I have found it is usually a consistent dark amber/orange in color with a thick but short lived head leaving some pleasant cream foam in the glass. It has the right balance of banana, clove and malt on the palate and finishes soft and pleasantly smooth. It is an easily drinkable beer. I have been back to buy out their stock on a regular basis and have turned several other beer lovers on to it here. It may not be the best example of the style available but I thoroughly enjoy it and find myself craving it whenever a poor cousin of the style is served.    ",,jhubeifc,Taiwan,,Le Bl dOr Weissbier
