Very little head, though it does attempt to lace somewhat.  The aroma hints of vanilla, and through the forward carbonation, I can taste a chocolate malt with a vanilla finish.  Overall it isnt bad, but its lack of body does not impress.  A pretty average porter. ",63.019,justadrop,Colorado,4.7%,Breckenridge Vanilla Porter

Not a whole lot of head despite serious attempts.  However, this pours dark and rich, with a chocolate/nutty aroma.  The bottle says ""chewy"" and this is evident on the first taste, in such a good way.  Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, Oso wonderful.  Despite being a porter, this is reminiscent of Founders KBS.
