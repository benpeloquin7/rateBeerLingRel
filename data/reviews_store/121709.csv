Back when me & my brother were little in the 80s our Grandmother used to let us have a cheeky little drop of this with lemonade (stout shandy) at Christmas time. Im 29 now & still drinking it at Christmas,me,my brother,one of my sisters,father,grandparents all drink it,we stocked up 28 cans this year.

Even get some bought for my birthday in October every year since i was 18.

Ive tried making stout shandys with other top brands of stout but none of them taste as good as Mackesons,love everything about it & hope to be drinking it for many years to come! =D ",32.299,Matty_29_uk,England,2.8%,Mackeson Stout
