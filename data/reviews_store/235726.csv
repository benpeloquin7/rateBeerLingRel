The chocolate accent is f***ing delectable.  Its gives just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the senses.  Although you can enjoy this anytime, this is best served as a dessert beer.

I had my first encounter with Leffe (albeit the blonde rather than the brown) while in an upscale bar in the Ginza district of Tokyo.  I was glad to find it on the shelf at a local specialty store. The brown has a very strong flavor and a satisfying aftertaste.  The aroma is adequate in its subtlety. It pours much better from the tap, which is a given, but the appearance was very nice even from a bottle pour. The taste is very good but not excellent. The texture and feel was also fine, but didnt earn a gold star in my book.  Overall, this is a very fine beer and pairs very well with ""heavy"" food like red meats and so on.
