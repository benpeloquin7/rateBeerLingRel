Looks unfiltered, kind of like water does when its far too aerated, but orange.  Just on looks, it looks neither good nor bad, Ive never seen a beer that looks like this.  Not nearly as hoppy as expected, but theyre there with an aroma of fruitiness.  Taste:  definitely wasnt expecting that!  Its very thick in the mouth and is very sweet.  It hides the 21% very well, but I dont think Id necessarily call this a good beer.  The finish is nice and it sticks to the palate quite nicely.  Its hard to say, Im really on the edge with this one;  its like nothing Ive ever tasted before.  One thing I can say, its a slow sipping beer.  Anything more than a small sip is too overpowering.  Although I usually like this in a beer, what I dont like is when the characteristic is so present that I have to worry about taking too big a sip.  I heard a lot of good things about this before picking it up today and I have to say it doesnt live up to the hype.  While it was an interesting experience, its not really my style, and definitely not worth 8 dollars a bottle. ",98.887,smag4life,Delaware,18%,Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA
