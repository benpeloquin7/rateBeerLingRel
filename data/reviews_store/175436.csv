I tour a lot through many countries and have the chance to drink a lot of different beers. This one is one of the best i had in many years. 
The beer is served in a deluxe blue bottle with some nice embossing, when opening the bottle a great authentic smell is flowing through your nose.
The smell is as rich as the beer tastes, full and spicy with a lot of aroma and natural refreshment. My new favorite beer.... ",23.326,Saeghel,Netherlands,5.5%,Gulpener Chateau Neubourg
