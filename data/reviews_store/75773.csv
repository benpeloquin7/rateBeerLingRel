One expects a Porter to be balanced, with a broad spectrum of flavors no one of which stands out; bitterness should be a combination of roasted malts and hops-derived.  Dead Reckoning is so hops-forward that hops bitterness and flavor entirely overwhelm any other flavor contributor which the brewers may have intended.  There are no malt flavors discernible.  It does have a smooth mouthfeel, presumably from a combination of specialty malts and its unfiltered, possibly bottle-conditioned packaging.  It is also a fine looking beer.

Thats what makes it so disappointing.  In the glass, it looks like Porter.  A fine cap of off-white foam, good lacing, appropriate dark brown with garnet highlights.  Then, when brought to the nose, the hops begin their unwanted, inappropriate assault.  

This is totally not what I expect from this fine brewery; though I expect every brewery to have at least one less-than-stellar product, the Bros. Troegner have until now given uniform satisfaction.  I guess theres a first time for everything.

Synopsis: Hopheads may find it appealing, but a porter aficionado will be disappointed. ",93.653,BobNQ3X,Pennsylvania,5.8%,Tregs Dead Reckoning Porter

Wonderfully fresh, but one would expect that, given the brewery is right out the back of the pub!

A delightfully subtle hops flavor and aroma and without excessive bitterness.  Condition perfect. Good lacing in the glass.  Slightly fruity; hops balanced by biscuity malt.  Star bright.  Dry, moreish finish.

I rather enjoyed drinking it. Its good to see that organic beer is just as good as any other.

The chestnut color is dead on for the style. Brilliant clarity. Nice parchment head, long-lasting lace of foam in the glass.

Aroma dominated by floral hops. Slight but complex malt aromas, with some roasted characteristics.

Flavor quite well balanced, with solid malt ably countered by a firm hops bitterness, finished by slight chocolate roastiness and nuttiness, combined with herbal, floral hops.  Finished slightly dry.

Moderate carbonation does not mask hops. Full mouthfeel is pleasant, but does not overwhelm.

Very ""moreish"". Its easy to finish one and pour another, and youd appreciate doing so.  If anything, its overhopped to be a NUT brown ale in the English tradition, but not so much that it slaps you in the face.

I liked this beer very much! It isnt the most complex nut brown ale out there, but a solidly-executed example of the style. Recommended. ",30.547,BobNQ3X,Maine,4.7%,Peak Organic Nut Brown Ale

Amber Ale is one of those styles that folks lose track of in the pursuit of Imperial IPA and Bigger! Faster! Louder! MORE! in their beers.  Its gratifying that at least one brewery still keeps one in their stable.

Lovely orange color with a generous light-tan head. Lacing follows the fluid level all the way to the bottom.  

Aroma is fruity, with sweet malt undertones to a solid spicy hops presence.

Flavor is full, though not quite enough balance for me; the hopping is generous enough that it requires a more solidly malty backbone. Some more caramelly sweetness would firm it up nicely. Fruity as a farmers market in the front, then the bitterness cuts through. Finishes dry and crisp.

All in all, I like this beer.  Is it the best Amber Ale ever brewed?  Probably not.  But it is a solid example of the style, and I would recommend it if a friend asked, ""Should I?""   ",30.015,BobNQ3X,Maine,4.8%,Peak Organic Amber Ale
