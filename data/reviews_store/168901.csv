Those have always a great presentation :) Pours with light amber, yellowish colour. White, not big but persistent, small bubbled head. Nose: descendants of saaz type hops, bready, pilsener malt scent. Mouthfeel: average carbonation. Taste: bready, malty, medium sweet, really slightly acidic. Obvious presence of high level of alcohol, but mildly covered by sweetnes and bitternes in aftertaste.
Beware! Its not a session beer, almost 9% abv!! :) Good for fiestas, goes excellently with proper meat portions :) Really good example of regional bire de flamande/garde. Brasserie de Saint Sylvestre, merci beaucoup!! ",75.383,mirogster,France,8.5%,St. Sylvestre 3 Monts

It?s Slovakian take on Sevre model of Pilseners - the Urquell. I still remember those beers back then, when its brewers were living in one country. Present Bazant is more like his own shadow from the old glory days. Thanks to ""red star"" brewing corporation - probably. It?s on the malty, sweet side, moderate to light body. Weak hops in aroma and taste - that?s the problem. Slight, shy bitterness in aftertaste - not enough imho. But still, it?s quite drinkable, not bad at all, decent session beer. Better than average eurolager - thats for sure:) ",,mirogster,Slovak Republic,5%,Zlat Baant (12% / Golden Pheasant / Premium)

Up front, overwhelming sweet cocoa extract is hiding absolutely everything beside it. Hint of bitterness in aftertaste. O: Sadly, not balanced at all.

Whoa, its one of my fav beer styles. Full appretiation on the warmer side only! Dont drink it when its cold!!!
App: pitch black/very dark brown with very nice, beige, small bubbled & low reducing but lasting head.

Mf&taste;: mild carbonation, very solid sweetish-malty backbone, followed by roasty,  coffie&bitter; sweet chocolate.
