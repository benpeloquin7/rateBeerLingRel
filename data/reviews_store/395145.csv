Just a hint of astringent but palatable. Had it over ice. Not sure it was worth the cost. One of the more expensive at the local coop. Definitely better than some others Ive had.  ,42.331,RedStarOvrRus,Washington,6.5%,Seattle Cider Semi-Sweet

Cloudy on the pour and biting on the tongue. Had to toss it away after drinking about 4 out of 16 oz. Thats when the headache started and I knew it wasnt going to get better. Leaves a very astringent after taste.  ,,RedStarOvrRus,Washington,6.8%,One Tree Crisp Apple

Third sip delightful, especially once the alcohol kicks in. Kinda fuzzy, bitter after-taste near back of tongue that diminishes with time. Better than most, preferable to some of the other lower alcohol content ciders. Not so foamy. Light in color, pleasing to the eyes in a dark room. Easily the best from a can. Epic, aromatic and down right gets the job done. Makes the walk home to an unpleasant domestic situation more bearable.
