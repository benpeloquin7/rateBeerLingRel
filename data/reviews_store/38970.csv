I love most of Primators beers (except the 21 degree) but this new hefeweizen they came out with is very bad.  Was excited because it is the only Czech hefeweizen available here and I got it when it first came out about 2 years ago but couldnt even finish the first bottle and poured out the second bottle so I could get my deposit.  Really bad flavor.  The only good hefeweizen in Czech is from Pivovarsky Dum the Light beer (Svetle) is very good.  Avoid this. ,62.599,BranikMan,Czech Republic,5%,Primtor Weizenbier

Was very happy when they introduced it this year in bottles.  Before it was available on tap infrequently.  It is better in bottles than on tap which is unusual.  The same great taste as the 10 degree but more flavor and a bit more sweetness.  I definitely reccomend it.  You can feel the extra alcohol the next day if you drink the 12 degree and are used to the 10 degree since the 12 is just as easy drinking as the 10.
