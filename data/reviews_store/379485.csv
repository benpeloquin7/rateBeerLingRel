The dryness of the former product, in my mind, was a particular style of cider. If Heineken want to appeal to the masses, simply add this ""golden apple"" or ""gold"" variety. Enough on this. The sweetness is not extreme, but at the same time it appeal to those with more of a ""juice-box"" pallet. The good news is that there are other dry ciders out there.

Found Blackthrorn by accident and was more than pleasantly surprised. I believe it might be a better cider than the former incarnation of Strongbow. I believe the aroma and taste is more balanced with a nice dry finish. Not sweet like so many of the lesser cider. Not sure I understand the jump to sweetness. The clean finish and crispness of this cider is so refreshing. excellent on the pallet without being overwhelming. yes, this is my new favorite cider without question.
