Aroma is tropical fruit. Appearance is very light orange. Taste is tart and tropical upfront with a nice dry and more sour finish. A little funkiness too. Medium to light mouthfeel. 
This is an amazing beer from a new brewery. They nailed it with their first brew.  ",90.258,TulsaBeer,Oklahoma,7%,The Willows Family Ales Family Ale
