Smokiness is nicely there, but for my palate it went from a nice bitter touch to a, dare I say, too sweet after taste.  Smooth, but many complex flavors for my palate.  Chocolate, coffee hints, to a sweet floral or citrus blend.  I think with the right dish, this would be excellent, but for my tastes, sitting watching a movie, the nuts and other salty snacks werent a good match.  I can definitely see myself cooking with this though.  Gotta get a brisket for it now. ",94.898,kbajan,Massachusetts,10%,Samuel Adams Imperial Series Wee Heavy
