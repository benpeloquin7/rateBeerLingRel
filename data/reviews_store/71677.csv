I was expecting a hoppy aroma when I opened the bottle, but I got a very malty aroma instead. The malt comes through in the taste a lot too, as a very caramel flavor. More hops to balance out the sweetness would make this beer a lot better. The mouthfeel is nice though. 

As someone stated in another review, this seems to be more of an ESB. I was not expecting an English Style IPA. For the price its not too bad, just not what I was expecting. ",30.441,cjowo,Maine,5.7%,Sea Dog (Old East) India Pale Ale
