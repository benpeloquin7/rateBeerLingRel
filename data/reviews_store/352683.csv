A - Deep gold hue with an off-white head. Quite clear but for a chill haze. Looks beautiful and inviting.
T - Yeasty on the attack. The floral and sweet notes shine through as the beer pours over the tongue. Just as the bitterness arrives, the crossover from sweet to bitter creates a false (and quite subtle) tart effect on the sides of the tongue. Blast of Stone IPA bitterness arrives on the finish and sits with you for a comfortable amount of time after the gulp. Wonderfully unique!
P - Body of the beer is spot on--full enough to match it&apos;s flavor complexity, but light enough to actually be refreshing. My only complaint is that I wish the carbonation were a bit smoother on the attack. I feel the carbobite masks a lot of the flavor you should taste the second the beer hits the tongue.
O - This brewery makes so many IPAs I don&apos;t even have the time or funds to try all of them (and I spend a lot of time and money on beer). This was one of the more unique IPAs I&apos;ve tasted from Stone and is a memorable and delicious twist on the classic Stone IPA. Great brew.

A - Smells of coffee and dark fruits, particularly raisins.

A - Pours ultra dark brown and looks fully opaque black as the glass fills up. The tan head recedes very quickly to only leave a little bubbly ring where the brew meets the glass wall.

T - Taste is consistent with the aroma. Initially sweet on the attack--tastes raisiny with a tinge of coffee and booze. The creamy milk stout qualities are revealed as a mere subtle gesture at the middle of the sip. The finish cuts right through these sweet/milky aspects and hits you with that roasty coffee flavor--a little woodiness and booziness is present as well.

P - On the attack of the sip I thought the brew was going to be over carbonated, but the bite mellows out pretty quickly and let&apos;s all the flavors take precedence. The initial bite may even work in favor of the beer, helping cut down the tongue&apos;s perception of the initial sweetness so that the sweetness doesn&apos;t take over. Really liked the mouthfeel of this brew.

O - This brew didn&apos;t rock my world, but it was an interesting--perhaps even memorable--drink. All at once, this brew showcases many flavors commonly found in 3 or 4 different stout varieties. It&apos;s reminiscent of Milk (first and foremost), Coffee, American Imperial, and even Irish (particularly the sour notes found in Guinness) Stouts. Really enjoyed this brew.

AROMA - smells of spices and tart fruits up front. A hint of alcohol in the aroma as well.

APPEARANCE - Brew pours a deep amber hue with a smooth and fluffy beige head.

TASTE - The attack hits you with spices and plenty of fruit flavors. It&apos;s actually much sweeter than I expected based on the aromas. Not way too sweet, but a tad syrupy. The middle of the sip continues that sweetness while the spices build then leave you with an alcohol chest warming on the finish.

PALATE - has a good amount of carbonation to it, perhaps just a hair too much. But it is satisfactory. The brew remains just smooth enough that the carbonation doesn&apos;t detract from wide array flavors and rich, silky body.

OVERALL - I enjoy this beer and I&apos;m quite glad I picked up a four pack. It has a lot of flavors packed inside and is balanced fairly well. My main deduction is that the brew&apos;s aroma made me crave more tartness in the taste, but I was given an unexpected amount of sweetness. Sweetness is a good thing (although I&apos;m not a huge fan of very sweet foods or beers), but I felt deceived. I&apos;ll take the Tremens or Nocturnum over this any other day, but this is nevertheless a good beer.

A - brew smells fruity, spicy, a bit malty, and boozy.

A - Pours beautifully. Very dark Amber and an appropriate level of murkiness for a Belgian. The light tan head looks silky as ever!

O - Definitely a great beer. I am a very big fan of Belgian ales and this one didnt disappoint. Its true to the Belgian strong dark ale style--Big, fruity, spicy, and boozy. It doesnt push the styles boundaries by any means. But I dont think thats what the brewers at Brooklyn set out to do with this beer. So with that, I consider this beer a success!

A - Smells of bourbon sweetness and alcohol up front. There is plenty of woodiness in the aroma and definitely a big malt backbone.

A - Pours like old motor oil! Super dark and opaque black with a tight, light brown head.

T - Woah! This is one of the more intense bourbon imperial stouts Ive tasted. The attack of the sip is loaded with bourbon sweetness and oakiness. The middle of the sip is where the deep maltiness makes its presence known. The bitterness starts to set in at this point as well. Upon swallowing, the brew has a big alcohol bite to it, but its a pleasant bite that cuts through all that maltiness and sweetness. Then youre left with a satisfying, bitter finish.

P - Very full and rich mouthfeel with the PERFECT carbonation level, if you ask me. Most bourbon stouts Ive tasted are enjoyably smooth, but a little too under-carbonated. This brew has a nice little ""carbobite"" that helps balance all the heaviness and sweetness of a barrel aged imperial stout.

O - Blown away. I will always remain loyal to my Memphis brewers, but I have seen many forgettable--good, but unremarkable--small batches and special releases get released by Wiseacre over the last year. This brew caught me by complete surprise. It is intense and very sweet, but ultra malty and balanced all at the same time. I believe this to be the brewerys finest specialty brew (if not finest brew, overall) to date. Thanks, Wiseacre!

I swirled the glass a little and tried out my sniffer one more time. I could still smell skunk, but a hint of breadlines was there this time. This brew looked appealing--golden and fizzy. It took a few minutes for the white, one-inch head to recede to a thin white sheet of fine bubbles floating atop the brew. When the beer first hit my tongue, I was fooled into thinking Id have a refreshing, slightly sweet pale lager to enjoy. Brew had a slight bready sweetness on the tip of the tongue, but when it flowed through the rest of my mouth it tasted like I was licking the inside of a wet cardboard box. Mouthfeel was a tad richer than I expected after the initial fizziness of each sip dissipated. I would count the tiny bit of unexpected richness as a plus. Overall, I very much hated this brew and I would definitely never give it a second chance unless I knew the first one I drank was defective or old.

Brew smells grassy, a little citrusy, with plenty of hop aroma present. Brew has a full, yellow color with just a little bit of haziness and rendered a white 1-inch head made up of fine bubbles--looks quite lush. Taste is grassy and citrusy at the beginning of the sip. The middle of the sip revealed that the brew has a pretty full malt profile and some floral notes! Then youre left with that perfect bitter and crisp finish. For a Pilsner, the body of the beer is quite ample, but still very refreshing. The mouthfeel has that nice bite of carbonation that doesnt stick with you too long so you can actually taste the beer. Ive tasted a few really good pilsners before, but this one tops my personal list. What a great brew!

Brew smells mild and fruity with a hint of corn. The pure golden hue and creamy white head look very inviting! Brew tastes fruity right from the beginning of the sip through the finish. Has subtle strawberry flavor. Actually tastes like eating a bowl of corn flakes for breakfast with strawberry slices on top. Body is lightly creamy and very drinkable. Overall this a refreshing and enjoyable brew. Would work well as a summer poolside drink. However the brew is quite simplistic in taste and didnt hold my attention for long.

Brew smells spicy foremost, some fruit aromas as well. This beer looks impeccable. Ive seen very few beers with such a vibrant yet natural and earthy hue. The lush off-white head stays at the top of the beer through the ENTIRE drink, and each time I tip my chalice, the foam smothers (not laces, smothers) the glass wall--amazing. Consistent with the aromas, I first taste the spices on the tip of my tongue. As the beer rushes through my mouth the creamy tingle dissipates a bit to reveal the beers subtle sweetness and floral notes. The finish is perfectly smooth and just a hint boozy. The mouthfeel of this beer is so delectably full and rich without being overwhelmingly heavy. The carbonation works so interestingly with an initial refreshing bite that turns into a smooth foam coating the tongue even after the finishing gulp. This is a fantastic beer and should be enjoyed by anyone who calls himself or herself a beer lover.

Bit of caramel sweetness rushes in at the middle of the sip. More floral notes appear on the bitter finish. P - Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Beer has very intense aromas and flavors. I feel the medium body and smoothness help balance those elements. O - Beer is so assertive in its flavors, but very well-balanced. Creates a great drinking experience. And the beer gets even tastier as it warms up!

A little floral and funky as well. A - Has a similar look to Arrogant Bastard Ale. Reddish Brown, but a bit more murky. T - Taste is noticeably more bitter than Arrogant Bastard Ale. Definitely woody up front, then just a little bit of sweetness in the middle. The finish leaves you with a good amount of bitterness that sits in the mouth for a half minute or longer. Yummy P - Heavier body than ABA, but not too heavy. Still just as smooth. Not overly carbonated. O - An interesting variation of the Arrogant Bastard Ales. Ive not had the Oaked ABA before, but its contribution to this blend is what I found to be most notably different from the original ABA. The extra hoppiness was enjoyable at first, but got to be a little overwhelming after a little while. The high bitterness clashed with the extra oaky smoothness just a bit. Nonetheless, this was a very enjoyable and intense beer!

A - brew smells sweet, floral, and bourbony. Reminds me of the scent of a floral shop. Also some bitterness and booziness in the aromas. A - looks terrific. Dark Amber hue, a little murky. Thin, off white head. T - the bourbon flavors are obvious, but not so blatant that they obscure the original ABA flavor. I taste bourbon and woodiness on the attack, floral and slight carmely flavors in the middle. The finish builds up the bitterness on the back of the tongue, which then recedes and leaves you with a creamy, almost vanilla-like, flavor for the finale. Great range of flavors, although I feel the heavy bitterness almost clashes with the smooth, sweet bourbon aspects. P - Delightfully smooth, and not too heavy! The slight vanilla notes imparted from the bourbon aging give this ale a tinge of creaminess in the finish. O - Ive found a few bourbon aged beers that Ive thoroughly enjoyed, but Ive also tasted some shitty beers that use this type of aging as a gimmick to sell off their inferior product. This beer surprised me! It works quite well with the bourbon flavors, because ABA already has a nice caramel sweetness in its flavor profile. Again, I feel the bitterness of the hops clashes a little with the sweetness of the bourbon. But the floral flavors and aromatics of the hops work well with woody characteristics from the aging. An impressive entry to the ABA family!

A - Woah! Big aromas in this beer. Smells very floral and boozy. Plenty of hop bitterness present as well A - Deep amber hue--just a tad darker than the standard ABA. The lightly tanned head receded down to a thin layer of bubbles that hung out atop the brew throughout the drink. T - The attack features an array of floral notes and plenty of malty sweetness which continues through the middle of the sip. The finish features that Stone signature blast of bitter which crescendos until it comes full circle and returns to the malty and caramely sweetness. Wow. P - Such a full and rich mouthfeel. I can feel my tongue counting up the calories. The bitter finish cuts right through the richness and gives it a nice balance. O - This is a BIG beer. Very full in maltiness and extremely bitter. But it, no doubt, creates an amazing drinking experience. This beer has such large range of flavors and aromas: malty, floral, bitter, and boozy. It is extraordinarily balanced for such an intense drink. Beers this bitter may not be for everyone, but i couldnt recommend it more. This is a supreme brew.
