Bright bitter hops initially then a sweet, malty, slightly heady alcohol flavour balanced by a grassy, piney flair as it finishes. Long aftertaste is sumptuous, leaving you wanting the next sip. Less bitter (hoppy) than the original Mad Tom, but much more refined and satisfying. I compare it to the Digfish Head 90min IPA (which is #1 IPA on America right now). It&apos;s actually better!
