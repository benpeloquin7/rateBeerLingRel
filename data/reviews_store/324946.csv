Having lived in Rio for 2 years 1956-58 and having tasted beer in many European countries and other venues I would say that the only country where I had beer as good as B/C was Germany. I also had excellent Heineken in St. Maarten , a Dutch possession for a long time, which apparently gets good Heineken beer somehow. Heineken available in the US is garbage, like all major bottled/canned beer available in this country since all of it is pasteurized.

PASTEURIZATION RUINS EVEN THE BEST BEER. I drink Pilsner Urquell since its the least bad, but I cry when I imagine how good the real thing must be in the Czech Republic.

IS THERE NO WAY OF GETTING BOTTLED, UNPASTEURIZED BEER OTHER THAN THOSE INFERIOR ""MICROBREWERY""
 PRODUCTS? WHY CANT BRAHMA CHOPP BE IMPORTED REFRIGERATED?
