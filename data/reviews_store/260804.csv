Beautiful in the glass.

Aroma: bready, spice and fruits with a slight alcohol presents.

Taste: very nice and well balanced. Floral tastes with fruity notes. Perfect bitterness, not too much not too little. Perfectly amount of spice tastes as well.

Overall: another excellent Belgian tripel. I have really gotten into Belgian style lately and this is another excellent example. ",98.78,joshualvsjenny,Belgium,9.5%,Westmalle Tripel

Pitch black almost a 60 weight motor oil appearance. Seems to coat the glass very well.

Aroma: very complex. Dark fruits, roasted malt, Carmel, hints of coffee and chocolate. A lot going on.

Taste: very nice, up front getting the roasted malts, coffee, caramel malt, dark fruits. The dark fruits aren&apos;t as forward as I would have expected given how noticeable they were on the nose, they are more in the background on the palate. The alcohol is nearly undetectable, which is very impressive, though I do get the warmth of it after the swallow.

Overall: awesome brew, this is my first Mikkeller beer and I&apos;m very impressed. Extremely well balanced and enjoyable. Be careful with this the alcohol is so unnoticeable it could get you into trouble real quick. ",99.947,joshualvsjenny,Denmark,10.9%,Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel

On the nose there is not much going on bready with a bit of sweetness.
Taste: follows the nose, just not a whole lot going on. Bready mildly sweet thin on the palate.
Overall: hate to say it ,but, I&apos;m disappointed in this, usually SA, while not the highest end craft brew usually puts out some pretty good offerings but this one just missed the mark.
