I love the whole shiner story (native Texan). It is an appealing spring seasonal, I really enjoyed the smooth flavor of it, It has a really clean taste up front, smooth in the middle and you can still have the taste a few minutes after finishing the beer. It resembles their original Bock a little bit, but is much less heavy...
