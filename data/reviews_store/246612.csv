Aroma is quite hoppy - citrus and pine with a hint of caramel as well. Carbonation is light but perfect for this style in my opinion the mouthfeel is also bang on with the right amount of oily-ness. Taste is quite hoppy a lot of pine and kind of skunky as well. The bitter and citrus flavours take over towards the end. The malts are quite balanced and suit the hops well they didnt go overboard on the caramel like some IPA/DIPAs. ,96.535,toadrush,Canada,8%,Tree Hophead Double IPA
