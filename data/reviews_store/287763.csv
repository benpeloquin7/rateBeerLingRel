Im really wondering if anyone has had quality DIPAs to compare this too?

A - Opened the can and immediately could see head coming out and a blast of flavor. Poured into a pint glass, a deep orange, gold, with a 2 to 3 finger off white head. This is how a DIPA should look!

S - I cant say enough good things about the smell, very pineapple up front, then grapefruit, sweetness, piney, orange, ends with on a curious note that is very inviting for a drink. Very appealing to the nose.

T - This is very complex to describe. Very balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, malty, pine. This is balanced so excellent. This is your traditional West Coast IPA on steroids.

M - A medium to high body, very smooth going down, a comforting feeling around the palate from carbonation, warming going down, I am assuming from the alcohol. Very balanced with the mouthfeel and very drinkable.

Overall - Ive had the other so called quality DIPAs out there, Heady, Pliny, you name it and I must say, this definitely should be hanging up there with the big boys. Everything is so balanced, very drinkable, and I cant understand how this has the score it does on here? Perhaps a bad batch? I had mine fresh I know that much forsure and this was a VERY good experience. I will be back for more. The Dudes nailed this one, balanced, they brought the complexity of all aspects of the hops, enjoyable, drinkable and more. A must try for any DIPA fan out there. I will definitely have this in my fridge at all times. Wow! ",39.104,actueel,California,10.8%,The Dudes Double Trunk
