Aroma was quaint and light. Taste was too malty, not enough hops for me. It didnt even really taste much like an IPA to me, more like a regular old pale ale. There are better beers out there. Maybe a good intro IPA to a friend that knows nothing but BMC. ",53.087,mrchubbs,Washington,6.7%,Pyramid Thunderhead India Pale Ale

For me it is the perfect IPA. Nice hop aroma and extremely smooth well-balanced taste. Drinking this on draft gives me a beergasm every time and its hard for me to stop drinking it once I start. Purely delicious. ,99.153,mrchubbs,California,7.5%,Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA
