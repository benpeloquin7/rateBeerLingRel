At 100 IBUs, one would expect to be knocked to their knees with bitterness, however Moralit is so wonderfully and fearfully balanced that all aspects of this beer shine through equally. The aromas are of sweet citrus and resin while the appearance is a vibrant, golden orange. The taste is bittersweet and the palate is more than pleasant. This is a spectacular beer.
