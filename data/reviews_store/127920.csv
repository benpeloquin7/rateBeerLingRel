Sweet chocolate and strong coffee flavors with hints of charcoal on the initial taste that fade to a smoky flavor near the end. Very similar in taste to Deschutes Black Butte porter but slightly thicker and smoother. Definitely should be called an Imperial. ,54.405,Drunknmonk,Washington,8%,Wingman P-51 Porter
