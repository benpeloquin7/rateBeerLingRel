This beer is loaded with beautiful hop aroma and flavor, with a balanced bitterness.  It is clearly a beer that has a large amount of hops in the recipe, just not added so early in the boil that their character gets lost.  If you must, think of this beer as a british style IPA, not an american one.   ",46.308,DohertyBrewing,Vermont,5.9%,Long Trail Unfiltered IPA
