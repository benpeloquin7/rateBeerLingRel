Then, after 12 days, we ate somewhere that offered Kuda Putih. What a relief! A light and clear easy to drink beer....but must be chilled. Not so nice if served a bit warmer. ""Bali cold"" is not cold enough. Ask for them to chill in the freezer first and you wont be disappointed. To put this in context, my beer of choice is Tooheys Extra Dry.
