I dont know if its widely available outside of Atlanta, but I grab a sixer from Greenes on Ponce DeLeon every time Im in town.

I can only describe the flavor as a light lager with some hints of chocolate, but its so much more complex than that.  Im sorry, this review doesnt do the taste justice, I just wanted to emphasize how infinitely excellent this beer is.  Get it fresh, get it now.

What a surprise coming from Dixie.  Crimson Voodoo pours a beautiful honey red, like the stock on my Mosin-Nagant.  The head seemed to have a very faint pink tint to it, which stuck around for a while and left a delicious lace.

Its smooth, a little on the flat side, and has a wonderfully rich feel on the tongue.  The flavor is like warm malty caramel, but not at all sharp.  If I could fault it I would say that its perhaps a bit lacking in carbonation, but I think that makes the more subtle flavors stand out.  Compare it to something like Abita Amber, which is all fizz and caramel, and no subtlety.

Definitely a new favorite. ",21.576,RegularDaddy,Louisiana,5.13%,Dixie Crimson Voodoo Ale
