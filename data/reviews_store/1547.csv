AND I LOVE IT!! Beast Light is my favorite beer, if it didnt have alcohol in it, id drink it all day.
    Many drunken times i have had off of this beer... and many great memorable times also.  For the price, you cant beat it... with what else can you buy a case of beer for 9 bucks.. sometimes 7! LONG LIVE THE BEAST ",,Michellex18299,Wisconsin,4.3%,Milwaukees Best Premium
