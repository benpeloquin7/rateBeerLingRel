Flavor was bland with notes of caramel. Very sweet and malty. Not sure what style they were going for here but its definitely a light-bodied session lager. If the brewers would give this beer a decent dose of hops to give it at least some perceived bitterness and aroma, it would be a much better beer. Hop it up boys. One word of advice: CASCADES! This brewery still seems stuck in the mentality that all its beers need to be ""drinkable"" by the masses. When you hear the word ""drinkable"" used to describe a supposed craft beer, run for the hills. That means they arent serious about brewing a really great, flavorful beer. Theyre aiming for the Killians crowd. For a brewery that has brewed Samuel Adams under contract, they know what they need to do but they arent doing it.
