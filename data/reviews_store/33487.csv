Funny story about this beer: The last time I got it, I got home and realized i had lost my bottle opener.  I tried to pry it open with my car keys (one of my less brilliant ideas).  I broke one key and had another key slip loose, causing me to rake my fingers across the sharp edge of the cap.  I ended up with 5 stitches in my index finger, and four in my middle finger.
