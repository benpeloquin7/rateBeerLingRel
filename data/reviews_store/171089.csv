Pitch black pour with fluffy beige head. Roasty wood aroma with touches of chocolate. Insanely creamy and smooth mouthfeel. They served this one at the perfect temperature to be able to separate and appreciate all the different levels of this brew. Creamy, velvet milk chocolate meets bitter roasted patent malts. There are some very subtle undertones of dark fruits and coffee that make this brew so dynamic. Quality stuff. They need to barrel age this thing.

It was nice to have a little citrusy hop flavor in the undertones as well. I did not expect that from the style.
