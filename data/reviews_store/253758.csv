I like this beer because it reminded me of NBBCs Ranger line which is my favorite dept. store brew. A craft beer should stand out from the rest because of the premium price imho, and this beer did not. However, this beer could definitely be a door opener for people who like sweeter beers to turn a new leaf. I will buy this beer again and try others from the company. This beer is brewed from one company and sold by another and craft beer is a delicate process which takes close attention so brewers beware.
