OK head, dissipates quickly. Smells sweet, some kind of grainy smell, a very slight lemony smell, not too bad. Aroma disappears shortly after the head, it seems. Pretty typical American lager color, maybe a little light. Doesnt look too appetizing. Tastes like... well, PBR. Nothing too complicated here, I imagine if there were a beer-flavored soda, it would taste something like this. Good mouthfeel for a cheap beer. Not too carbonated. Ive drunk a million of these, so its hard to break it down. I think I like it better out of the can. Everyone knows what the purpose of this beer is; it isnt really for savoring. But it does its job, and I hear it won a blue ribbon at one point. ",1.618,jackcarlisle,California,5%,Pabst Blue Ribbon
