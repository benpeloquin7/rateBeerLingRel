I get a pack of 4 from the local liquor store ever week. Ive microbrewed myself, tasted thousands of microbrew companies, and travelled to europe frequenting foreign beer, but the Nelson Imperial 924 series is THE best tasting beer Ive had. I love it. Its not too hoppy which I hate. Its very malty and frothy. Its got a good fullness flavor too. I love it, love it, love it!!!   ",95.318,ckwun,Oregon,8.6%,Widmer Brothers Deadlift Imperial IPA
