Surprisingly delicious for a fruit flavored beer.  Pours a cloudy golden blonde with a white quickly dissipating head.  The aroma is of apples and wheat.  The apple flavor is suprisingly subtle when tasted though.  A delicious balance of sweet wheat notes that call to mind a hefeweizen with a hint of apple. A fine beer for dessert or with a snack.    ,74.304,UCLABruin,Canada,5.5%,Unibroue phmre Apple
