Tart, highly carbonated, and low alcohol make this one of the most refreshing beers in Austin.  Seems like they drew a lot of inspiration from Dogfishs Festina Peche - and thats fine by me. ",65.644,HopDropandRoll,Texas,3%,Black Star Co-op Pub & Brewery Waterloo

I still enjoyed this beer, but I thought of it more as a hoppy Porter than a Black IPA.  Plenty of bittering hops, a decent amount of flavor hops, but not much in the aroma department.
