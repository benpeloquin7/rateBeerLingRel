Was surprised to note the high Alc. content on reading the label as it slipped down quite easily. Couldnt really tell what the colour was like as  the bar was dimly lit but got a strong fruity-malt flavor from this.   Had a second bottle of this and liked it just as much.  Keen to try more from the Unibroue outfit,  this really is an impressive brew. ",98.62,yodel,Canada,9%,Unibroue La Fin du Monde
