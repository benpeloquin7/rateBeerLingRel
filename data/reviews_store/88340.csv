Bottle. Not a big fan of the hop bombs so I figured Id give this a go. Nice lace and an unclear gold. Not copper at all. lots of floral and a mellow grapefruit overtone. Hints of almonds or something but as I delved in became more like a cedar. Not to shabby. Would buy again. ,89.803,steez,Pennsylvania,5.2%,Victory Headwaters Pale Ale

Initial aroma was hoppy raspberrys.
Interesting and complex for an IPA. Pour was amber and head was a bit weak. At first taste it seemed a little boozy but was followed by another shortly thereafter. a little on the sweet side but drinkable for sure. ",99.788,steez,Delaware,9%,Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA
