This is a Nelson Sauvin hop bomb! 
Aroma: It is abscured by Nelson...no fruity aroma or spice only Nelson wine/grape like aroma. No spice detected or yeast phenols.
Appearance: Golden in color, nice head, and ""Belgian lace."" Very effervescent. Looks the part of a Saison...
Flavor: Low fruitiness and spice flavors. The tartness the grape/wine of the Nelson hops overwhelms the palate. The bitterness is high and not balanced.
Mouthfeel: Very light body typical of a Saison but the drinkability is inhibitted by the astrigent hop bitterness on the back end. This beer leaves you with a near puckering sourness/bitterness.
Overall: This is the worst Saison I have ever tasted. The Nelson Sauvin hops overwhelm the characteristics of the Saison. It is not refreshing due to the high bitterness and tartness of the Nelson Sauvin hops. I cannot taste or smell any Belgian characteristics in this Farmhouse Ale.
