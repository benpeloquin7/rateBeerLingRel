I like this beer. There is a time and place for everything; yes, even Faxe 10%. It may not taste the greatest, one may go so far as to say it taste like steel. I wont lie, it does taste/ smell similar to a iron clad battleship saturated in gasoline, but it also has the same power.  Powerful stuff. cheap, tolerable and does its purpose.
