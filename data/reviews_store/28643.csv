Being an ex homebrewer for almost 10 years, I was struck with the rocky head that exploded with hop artoma.  Reminded me when I was weighing out 8 ounces of Centennial whole hops for a 1 barrel IPA I had made back in the day.  As if the damn beer was made an hour ago!  Fresh is not the word for this beer.

ABV  is big @ 8% , so only the experienced need apply.

Graet beer, all the better that it was offered at the tap room obscura..""The Grey Lodge Pub"".
