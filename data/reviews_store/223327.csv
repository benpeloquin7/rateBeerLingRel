Its a more complex version of lower ABV beers without tasting like something youd swill for $2 at a dive bar. A few folks have mentioned that it takes more than a sip to pick up on some of the subtler notes in this one. 

I get some soapy hits on the first sip and then some blueberry/oat flavors build up. The aroma is berry heavy as well. Overall, very clean and well balanced.  ",44.532,goneaway,Colorado,4.2%,TRVE Hellion
