Strong berry aroma and flavor but low on the spices. I expected more of a witbier character and didnt pick up much as far as spices/yeast. Not bad for a regular fruit ale but I think it masks the witbier character I hoped for. I ended up choosing the other sample. ,26.207,spauldib,Massachusetts,5.5%,Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier
