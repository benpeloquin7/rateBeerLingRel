I dont quite understand the ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" reasoning on the label, but I do agree with the deScription of this beer...
Not the biggest, or the most bitter (120 IBU???), but definitely ""waves of hoppy goodness"". The best Heady Topper I had this summer was on draft because I happened to be in Vermont at the right place at the right time!
Insanely drinkable. A session beer for hopaholics only. ",99.947,JohnBeer1964,Vermont,8%,Alchemist Heady Topper
