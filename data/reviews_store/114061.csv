Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. This bottle was gotten due to a good friend of mine wanting to go to a CCB cask event and me taking his shift for him so he could attend. Im sure that will make it that much better.

A-pours an insane black that when help up to the light changes nothing. Never seen a beer this dark and the name fits. I very thick head in the shade of mocha with a rocky top is taking a while to melt. impressive do to the abv. The heal melts very slowly and leaves think sheets of bubbly lace.

S-The smell is very complex. Waves of dark chocolate and hints of coffee. Smells are cohesive and no alcohol is apparent. 

T-I cant express how much excitement built in writing the previous parts to this review and on the first taste I am AMAZED. I have had a number of highly ranked souts and the flavor of this only beets them by a small amount. But the best thing is that the balance is perfect. This bottle will reach its recommended consume after date next month but as of right now. The waves of dark chocolate and mild sweet coffee with hints of licorice even bits of oak. They all come together with perfect balance and without any other offputting flavors. EPIC.

M-mouthfeel is luxurious smooth and full. It has enough fullness to coat your mouth with complex flavor. Leaves no dryness or any funky after taste.

D-Drinkiability is amazing and flawless...this beer leaves me speechless... believe the hype.

A-Pours a dark brown with almost night highlights when held to the light. The head is shade of khaki and is about a 1/2 in tall and leaves speckles of lace on the glass. Looks great! Only flaw is the head didnt last as long as I would like. 

S-Smell is rich and nutty with some mild tinges of chocolate also some hopy scents come through a tiny bit but if i was blindfolded I would say this is a great example of a brown ale.

T-I have to say this hybrid style of beer has to be my favorite. The idea of having this much rich nutty maltiness combined with a decent hop bite is amazing. I get waves of nuts and chocolate followed by refreshing zesty hops.

M-The moutfeel can carbonation are balanced just as well as the hops and the malt. This beer is full enough bring presence to the beer and the carbonation is just enough to let you know its there but no where near enough to be a distraction. awesome.

D-The drinkability of this is amazing. I like it even better than dogfish Indian brown. Its smooth and sweet and hopy and bitter all at the same time. Although ultimateness I wish they would make a double version of this with an ABV of like 12 and like 120 ibus. Yet another stellar beer from terrapin.

A-Pours jet black. Small amount of light penetration. Emphasis on small.Mocha head thats rocky and pits nicely. Leaves a decent amount of spotty lace.

S-Lots of chocolate not too bittersweet coffee hints. sparks of hops that are undetermined.

T-Bittersweet chocolate dominates. Not much in the way of roasted coming through but hints of coffee are apparent. Hops are in the taste as well just enough to add a little intricacy.

A-Pours tangerine and gold with an ultra white head made of foamy bubbles. Not lace on the glass and quite a few carbonation bubbles inflating the head a bit.

S-citrus fruity sweetness dominates the nose with some other interesting spice. But not really all that much here. Banana and wheat are there in short supply.

T-Only real flavor her is an overpowering sweetness and nothing to back it up. Not enough malt at all and the flavor seems added.Where the hell is the wheat?

M-Overcarbonated and thin but not to the point of me not being bale to finish it.

A-Poured into a pint glass from the tap. Pours a light amber with flecks of red. decent amount of speckled lace head is Bone white.

S-I am not sure whats up with the scent of this beer. It smelled very musty. Not sure why but the scent of something close to wet towels killed all other scents in this beer. Almost to the point of me questioning drinking it.

T-Taste is awesome. Lots of malty sweetness with a very mild amount of bitterness at the end. Good complexity with nothing clashing terribly.

A-Pours a pale gold with a white head. Fairly typical of any pilsner nothing really special but I havent seen a pilsner yet that stuns me visually 

S-Smells like German hops. Mild minuscule citrus flavor with some scents of weak grain.

T-The taste is surprising. I feel that the nose was a lot more relaxed and sort of fooled me into thinking mild bland pilsner. There is a lemon-grass undertone that keeps the beer mildly exciting. A little malt is present as well as some clean crisp hop-ness sneaking in for a bit.

M-Mouthfeel es excellent for the style. Perfect balance between light enough for drinkability and full enough to avoid boredom. Very obvious that lots of time went into the creation of this beer..then again paulner has been around since 1634 according to the bottle

D-Drinkability is stellar of course. As most pilsners are. All the aspects of this beer come together well enough for it to be sessioned for as long as ones alcohol tolerance can stand. Nothing at all wrong with this beer but nothing that makes it stand out from the crowd either.

A-Pours a shade of apricot with a grainy bleached white head. A decent amount of bubbles rise to the top holding up the head thats leaving thin sheets of lace that look like spiderwebs.

S-smells like a plethora of fruits-over ripe apples mild banana and sweet guava. Also a mild belgianish scent as well. Hints of spice as well.

T-This is a great Saison. There is an instant fruit sweetness that reminds me of cider made from green apples. Next is immediate sour like tart sour apples. Guava is apparent throughout the beer but the sour overlaps it in the end. Guava Grove also has a sweet and clean finish that increases drinkability. As the bar warms it only becomes more balanced. The sour becomes more mild and the sweet fruit flavors of apples and guava shine through. All and all the balance is near perfect. Alcohol is completely non existent.

M- The mouhtfeel has a slick feeling too it. The mouthfeel seems to be the weakest part of this beer. By no means is it lacking or sub par. But I feel that for a beer this good it good be better. The carbonation is dead on I just feel that even after warming the mouthfeel is still a little too thin.

D-The drinkability is stellar. After a small amount of warming this beer is soo balanced and smooth as well as flavorful and intricate. By far my favorite saison.

If I was rating on a scale of 5 to the style this would easily be across the board. The smells erupt from the glass the taste is not only dead on for the style but also downright explosive for a wheat beer.

S-mild amounts of coco with some nuttiness and licorice. Also a mild bitter character that falls more along the lines of dark chocolate then hops.

T-The taste is all coco with bittersweet chocolate. Not bad by any means but lacking some complexity. Lets see if warming helps it out. Road dog gains sweetness as it warms but the complexity doesnt get much deeper. Still a very tasty porter but nowhere in line with the big leagues.

M-sadly this beer is a little to thin for the likes of porters. I feel that carbonation is too high as well.

D-The drinkability is alright. However its not great. Porters should be smooth and silky with layers to go through before swallowing.

T-The flavor is fruity and balanced I get apples and maybe raisins? a tiny bit...others as well but im sure my pallet is not advanced enough to pick up on them. The alcohol may as well be non-existent. Which I find dangerous as its stated at 7.5% on the bottle. Cant really find anything wrong with it but at the same time I have had others in the same style that jump off the pages of my memory a bit more....as it warms the sweetness dulls down a bit and the alcohol comes in a bit more .
