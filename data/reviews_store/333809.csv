Smell is modest with light fruit and tartness. Flavor is much stronger than the nose. Light fruit, lemony with a hint of peach. The lactic tartness has a punch but soft. The carbonation cleans your tongue nicely making the beer very refreshing. Much more sour than most saisons, but still quite enjoyable.

The beer starts off with a gentle scent of citrus. The tartness comes off as slightly sweet smelling. The color is a pale straw with nice head retention. The flavor matches the smell, citrusy and tart. This is an easy drinking and very refreshing beer. If you enjoy wild and sour beers then this 100% brettanomyces witbier is a must. Low funk and highly fruity. ",98.513,paulysci,Colorado,5.5%,Crooked Stave St. Bretta (Summer)
