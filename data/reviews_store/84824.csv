Exactly the color I want to see in a vienna. The nice head, but it vanishes quickly.  

Big malty aroma and flavor, but not the best finish in the world.  A bit too sweet.

For the price $6.00 for a six pack, you cant possibly go wrong.

I wouldnt be mad at anyone who brought some of this by to a party... ",30.757,stonesean,California,5.7%,Trader Joes Vienna Style Lager

Nice pils head, strong herbal finish. I found mine to feel a bit thin.  Not malty enough for my tastes, but it is a pils after all.  Hops are the star.

This is the very essence of a ""good"" beer. 

Pleasing red-gold color, near perfect hop aroma, a decent malt flavor, though I prefer a stronger maltiness, perhaps it should last longer?  

Fine lacing on the glass lets you know you indeed have the good stuff. 

I have a friend in Stuttgart that carries ""beers of the world cup"" in his pub around World Cup tournament time, this is the one that represents the USA, and most Germans are pleasanly suprised. ",55.282,stonesean,Massachusetts,4.9%,Samuel Adams Boston Lager
