Pours with a orange hue, moderate head, and disapates quickly.  

Light hop aroma.  

Taste comes off as similar to green flash.  Lots of initial hop bite, lingering for some time.  The higher carb carries the hop flavor.

Overall, a very drinkable IPA. ",90.776,PSmurf78,Washington,9%,Big Time Whiny the Complainer
