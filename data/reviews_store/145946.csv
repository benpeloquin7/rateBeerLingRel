\Hard to find anything in the sweet stout category better than this.

I wasnt sure what I was getting with this beer, but since Ive liked sixpoints beers so far, decided to just take a chance and grab a four pack (instead of a single, which was an option, as Gabriels superstore also sells singles). No need, sixpoint has done me right so far, so whatever it is, its likely to be good. This remains my main concern about these beers tho, the labels dont make it exactly clear what style of beer is inside. 

All that aside, the aroma and flavor were pretty consistent with the commercial deScription, that of a malty IPA. This one is more ""balanced"" (if thats even possible with an IPA) than the more ultra-aggressive versions we frequently see these days, and is actually far more towards the balanced side than sixpoints own ""resin."" While resin is a hop blasting, in your face IPA, this one is more relaxed and subdued, actually quite perfect for autumn. The hops are piney and citrus, and balance out a solid malt backbone that has crystal and caramel malts, a little toast and some biscuit, and a touch of spice.

Body is medium and finishes more malty than hoppy. Carbonation is slightly on the lower end of the IPA spectrum but is smooth and perfectly balanced with the rest of this beers profile.

Aroma and flavor are somewhat more like my idea of a German pilsner, grainy, grassy, but still with that classic kolsch yeast note and some spiciness. 

Its certainly easy to drink, tasty, and fits my idea of the level of quality that Ive come to expect from RABC.  ",73.326,alcaponejunior,Texas,5.2%,Real Ale Brewers Cut Kolsch

Pricey, like most of Rogues ales. Theyre good, dont get me wrong, but sometimes the price makes me seek other beers. Just a note, mind you. Beer is beer, quality is quality, Rogue is good quality beer. 

This one pours a slightly hazy dark auburn/red with a pretty good head that left good lacing and lasted quite a bit.

Aroma and flavor wise, this one is dead-on for what I think of when I consider an American amber/red ale. Pungent maltiness, biscuit, caramel, toffee, some fruits with emphasis on darker fruits, with an appropriate balancing hops presence, which is high, and matches the ABV well. 

Rogue did a good job with this one on flavor, body, taste. 

Im starting to be able to taste the pacman yeast more consistently now. While I do understand why a brewery might use a specific yeast all the time (not an uncommon occurrence), I sometimes would like to taste things that specific brewers might create if they could use different yeast more often, like us homebrewers do. Rogue with English ale yeast or Irish ale yeast? Stone with US-05? Might be interesting. ",87.973,alcaponejunior,Oregon,9%,Rogue Imperial Red

Sometimes sixers of these are available in my area. Ive had it before, just putting up a review here.

Tannish yellow and clear, huge head that lasted and great sticky lacing.

Smell is good but understated, with malt, biscuit and fruit aromas coming forth first, followed by a barely detectable hops.

This one tastes pretty good, and Im enjoying drinking it. Its pretty malt forward, fruity, with a smooth balancing hops thats more noticeable in the taste, but still isnt overly strong. 

Its a well balanced beer thats damn easy to drink. Carbonation is medium and creamy smooth. Finish is slightly dry with a lingering light bitterness.

I quite liked this beer and will happily buy sixers of it for my regular fridge stock when available in my area. Im really liking Brooklyn brewery and will continue to choose their beers.

Great looking, monster head that lasted and eventually settled to about a quarter inch of dense white foam, leaving super sticky lacing all over the glass,

Aroma is grainy, with a touch of hoppiness. Typically pilsner.

Flavor is nice, its lightly sweet but bitterness is a bit stronger, a nice hoppiness and a strong grainy malt backbone. Flavorful by pilsner standards, but quite on the money.

Seems almost medium bodied, not at all watery, yet still refreshing, leaving a lingering hop bitterness.

Aroma is nice, milk chocolate, roasty, milky, malty, coffee. Flavor is somewhat on the same lines, but the milky and creamy chocolate flavors are more pronounced. Theres a good touch of roasty flavors, and just a hint of burnt, but mostly milk chocolate dominates. 

Body is thick, creamy, slick, and carbonation is low. I personally prefer a little more in the way of carbonation, even in a stout, but its not out of range for the style.
