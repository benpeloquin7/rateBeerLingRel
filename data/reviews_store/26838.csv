Smell:   Oaky caramel, with vanilla and figs

Taste:  Opens with a spice cake flavor that adds a dark fruit dimension by mid-palate, along with a rich oaky caramel flavor that acts as icing on the cake; after the swallow, the rum-soaked fig and raisin flavors are joined by vinous elements to add complexity to the finish

Mouthfeel:  Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation; a little thin for the style

Drinkability:  All in all, a decent quad; what it lacks in heft and depth it counterbalances by avoiding the overly sweet boozy mess that I sometimes encounter in the style ",80.547,brentk56,Colorado,10.2%,WoodVille #21
