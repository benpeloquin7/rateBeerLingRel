The NZ beer festival. Not much on the nose initially, however develops into a creamy, vanilla, nutmeg plate as it warms. Very bright copper/orange hue.

WTF Black IPA?? This beer is defiantly a great seasonal, mid to dark ale. Full copper tones. The nose suggests great piney Roguish characteristics, Flavor is an interesting mix of West Coast meets East Coast IPA, lots of grapefruit characteristics, which blend with the pine and caramel, resiny almost stone fruit of the malt. Would make a great fall beer and kept well enough to make it to New Zealand in one piece. .  ",90.031,tumekebrewing,Oregon,6.6%,Rogue Mogul Madness
