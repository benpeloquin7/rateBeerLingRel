This one is classified as an American IPA, basically their 60 Minute IPA, with the Syrah grape must added, prior to their proprietary yeast being used for fermentation.

Appearance: Pours to a brownish, ruby color with some pink highlights shining through with some light. It has a slight chill haze, and a brilliant white head of tight bubbles. The head pours to about 1/2"" but dissipates and hangs to edges of the glass edges. Little to no lacing.

Appearance Rating: 2 out of 3

Aroma: The first hit is a pleasant mix of the floral, perfumy hops DFH 60 Minute is known for and the strong scent of grapes and grape skin. Sweet malt brings up the finish, giving it a champagne-like sweetness to the overall aroma.

Aroma Rating: 10 out of 12

Flavor: The floral hops are, again, the dominant first flavor, then the grape/wine fruitiness, followed by the hop bitterness and malty backbone of the IPA to finish. Somewhat tart. The hops and grapes marry perfectly together, they do not compete for your attention. This brew finishes extremely dry and actually ends with a nice balance, not leaving a totally dominant flavor from either the wine or beer. No real driving yeast character to speak of. As you drink the beer, the hops do get lost, other than their mild bitterness at the backend. It drinks like a dry champagne with a quality beer finish.

Flavor Rating: 15 out of 20

Mouthfeel: Fairly light body with high carbonation, effervescent. A mild puckering effect from the astringency of the grapes. Finishes very clean on the palate.

Mouthfeel Rating: 3 out of 5

Overall: Extremely complex. About as perfect a blend of the beer and wine worlds as I have tasted to date. The classification as an American IPA doesnt seem quite right, due to the high level of dryness and the thinner body than the style calls for, but  still a very good brew. This could bridge some gaps for many wine drinkers, without a doubt.

To me, this brew works the same way a Saison is successful. Not because it tastes like a Saison, because it doesnt at all, but because it has such a clean, palate cleansing finish to it. It would be fantastic as a palate cleanser between courses at a meal or paired with just about anything rich in flavor.

I had to check it out and give their lineup a try to see if it lived up to the hype. I was not disappointed! They dont bottle and have little, if any distribution, so good luck getting your hands on some of this unless you get out to the pub. The beers were all well above average and the food, atmosphere and workers were great too. Check out their website, and I encourage a visit anytime you get out towards Philly.

This brew is an American IPA with mangos called Mago Tago, that was a brewpub only release, and it only lasted a couple of days. I just happened to stop in when it was available, and after trying it, I had to take some home! The brewer must be into obscure progressive rock, the name of this brew has to be an homage to the German rock group Cans album Tago Mago. Here is my take on this glorious beer!
 
Apperance: It pours to a very cloudy, opaque straw yellow color with a bright white 1 head, with tight bubbles that dropped down fairly quickly to about 1/4 and stayed there through the rest of the beer, hanging on to the side of the glass, lacing like a quality Belgian Ale.
 
Aroma: Its a full-on frontal assault with ripe mango and tropical hop aroma hitting hard in the beginning, some sweet candied orange, a slight alcohol warmth, a light breadiness and some sour notes that I can only attribute to the fruit or wheat used when brewing. It wasnt off-putting at all, just minor background I picked up after swirling the beer a little.
 
Flavor:The sweet mango comes first again followed by a crisp tropical hop bite and a little sweet malt and wheat. A mild bitterness from the hops and low alcohol warmth hang on the back for just the right amount of time, creating a fantastic balanced finish. Finally, there is a pleasant tropical fruity tartness that stays on your tongue.
 
Mouthfeel: It has a very creamy mouthfeel from the wheat used in the brewing process, high carbonation and very dry finish. There is also a mild astringency caused by the fruit, but works perfectly with the medium body and dryness overall.
 
Overall: Tremendous balance in this brew, with the mango and tropical hops leading the way, the creamy texture and high carbonation brought it all together, toning down any bitterness and making this a special beer that I hope to see Tired Hands expand its production and maybe bottle for sale in the future. Think Zombie Dust or Alpha King by 3 Floyds Brewing Company with the perfect mix  of mangos! Awesome Stuff!

Nice clarity and legs that run down the side of the glass all day! The color in the picture doesnt quite represent the beer, it has a much lighter, more transparent look to it.

Aroma - The alcohol bloodies your nose as soon as you dip into it. Hints of caramel, brown sugar malty sweetness. Orange, citrus and dark cherries round it out.

Flavor - The first taste is of dark fruit, with a big alcohol hotness through out the middle and a mild hop bitterness in the end. Lingering earthy, slight citrus hop bitterness and the taste of bitter orange on the back. There is an ever so small malt flavor that hangs in there too, but the finish of fairly dry overall. The hops are not as forward as I would expect in an American Barley-wine, using Bigfoot by Sierra Nevada as the benchmark for this style.

Mouthfeel - Heavy body as one would expect from a Barley-wine, low carbonation with a biting alcohol hotness that dominates.

Overall - To me, the alcohol was a little overwhelming and it really took control of the flavors and aroma. With some age it would mellow out considerably, im sure, but I was hoping for something a little more special from 21st Amendment. This one just falls a little short for me. I have a couple more cans cellaring in the basement and will revisit this one in a year or so, and hopefully get the flavors I was yearning for!

Aroma - First hit with a big tropical fruit, peach, apricot hop aroma, some malty sweetness, very fruity and refreshing

Flavor - The attack is a great fruity hop profile, just like the aroma, with sweet malty notes in the middle and a very pleasant orange and honey bitterness on the back end, the bitterness lingers for just the right amount of time and does not overwhelm the palate, for being 9.4% ABV this brew does not show its alcohol strength. The malt and hops are in a good balance for the style.

Mouthfeel  Medium Carbonation, heavy malty body that coats the mouth a little bit, ever so slight alcohol warmth and a tingling bitter sensation remains on the tongue at the end

Overall - An excellent Double IPA that has a big fruity hop profile that is not that common in the usual DIPA suspects. It doesnt seem to have the big IBUs that some hop heads seem to gravitate towards, but this brew has a decent balance that could make it a little more accessible to be a crowd pleaser. The only down fall to this one that I found was the coating of the mouth by the thick heavy malt body, but to me, that is a minor problem and I could enjoy this brew on a regular basis, if only Great Lakes decides to make it year-round! Right now it is only considered a Spring Seasonal beer and may already be gone from the shelves. ",99.418,Beergelden,Ohio,9.4%,Great Lakes Chillwave Double IPA
