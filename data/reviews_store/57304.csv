The Rye Squared is an entirely different animal.

In my opinion is has little resemblence with its ""single"" cousin.  This is a very good beer, and hoppier than I expected.  The color is fanstastic, great body despite not a lot carbonation.

Very dark, looks like motor oil, I cant see through the glass.  Fruity aromas, no head whatsover.  High alcohol but not as apparent as I thought.  Flavors are all over the place and lingering aftertaste stays with you.
