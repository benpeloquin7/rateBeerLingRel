And I do love them so. BUT its refreshing to taste an IPA that fulfills the hop addiction and offers something different. This beer does just that. The body manages to be creamy while still offering a substantial hop kick right up front. Thats not something you see every day. Its crisp and clean but still has that rich IPA flavor. At around 6.5, its not the heaviest out there but it does have a good punch. If youve enjoyed Mad Hatter, Sun King Osiris or similar lighter bodied hoppy brews you will like this beer. Its very refreshing and very flavorful. I dig it. Nice work from a new brewery! ",42.602,jiggitytiggity,Indiana,6.3%,Cutters Half Court IPA
