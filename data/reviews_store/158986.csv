A - light gold, clear body, one finger head dies to film. Swirl revives it nicely with spotty lace.

S - big big tropical fruits, mango, peach.

T - more tropical fruits, mango, apricots, huge malt backbone means a delight to drink. Noticeable lack of citrus/pine archetypal DIPA flavours. Almost sweet-ish. Hops on back palate but not sharp in any way.

P - medium weight, almost thick in some ways. Not oily. Light carbonation as you would expect from growler. Would be higher score I supect if not from a growler.

O - big and bold, but oh so drinkable. Sensational stuff. This is a really balanced big beer, and the alcohol is so well disguised it is dangerous. One of the best beers currently available in Australia.

Sensational AIPA with emphasis on early, not late bittering, hops. Delighful looking with spottyy lace everywhere. Smooth tasting with hops to the fore, floral/grassy and good malt, but mainly hop driven. Quite akin to Riverside 77.
