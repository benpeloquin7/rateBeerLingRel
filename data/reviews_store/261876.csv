Thick and dark, almost oily.
It barely made a hiss when opened but had the perfect amount of carbonation. Tons of dark fruits, raisins and molasses in the nose and mouth. Maybe a slight woody aftertaste? however quickly overshadowed by the other much stronger flavors. Dont know if Id call this an Imperial Brown Ale, to me it tasted more like an english barley wine/wee heavy hybrid. ",98.082,Giak,Scotland,11.5%,BrewDog Abstrakt AB:10

Dark as the night with a fantastic thick brown head. Chocolate and coffee dominate the aroma followed by raisins and soy? (it vaguely reminded me of dark olive paste). Mouthwatering. The taste does not disappoint. Wonderfully balanced in the mouth. The acrid, roasted flavors from the roasted barley and counterbalanced by a good amount of residual sweetness. That umami/dark olive component that was in the aroma comes also back in the mouth. ",99.841,Giak,Ohio,9.4%,Hoppin Frog BORIS The Crusher

I should have expected it to be a sour ale to be historically accurate... and I just dont find sour/tart beers enjoyable. If you like sours, give it a try. It reminded me of a geuze (it looks like sour is the new black nowadays) but with an additional layer of flavors, probably due to their additional funky ingredients.
I had a clay aged wine and it had a similar tartness and base flavor profile. ",86.528,Giak,Italy,9.3%,Birra del Borgo ArcheoBirra Etrusca - Anfora

The hops should defintely feature way more prominently (late additions & dry hopping) to be considered a Black IPA. It is more of a stout! The IBUs are there allright. But in the nose and mouth it is kinda muted.
