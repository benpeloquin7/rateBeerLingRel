Aroma of floral coffee notes with some roasted malt notes is quite pleasant. Taste is a nice mix of floral coffee with no astringency and some light roasted malt notes with light lactose notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Tasty porter with nice coffee profile and good drinkability.  ,89.183,Boutip,Canada,6%,Left Field Bricks & Mortar Porter
