I went out and purchased four extras to share with friends -- hopefully will be able to resist opening one and let it age for a few years to see how this tastes in the future. Thanks to the wine that is blended in, it has a very unique taste -- delicate and fruity and cheerful when cold -- more robust and sophisticated as it warms up. Incredibly drinkable, alcohol seems almost completely masked. There is a spice to it I cant put my finger on, but no matter how you drink it, it is very refreshing and I think would pair well with almost any meal -- from burgers to sushi.

Very hazy yellow -- you cant see through a glass no matter how you hold it up to the light. Almost no head at all, no matter how you pour it, but a gauze of tiny white bubbles across the top. In going through a six-pack slowly over the last month or so, this beer has gradually grown on me. Originally, I didnt like it nearly as well as Victorys HopsDevil, which is probably sitting right next to it on the shelf at your store, but it is a very respectable beer in its own right, and has a distinct bitter finish that has grown on me, as well as a nice little kick from being a doubleIPA. Id call it something of a developed taste, but very enjoyable. ",96.705,geronimorex,Pennsylvania,8.5%,Victory Hop Wallop
