Medium, short duration, off tan head, that left nice sticky lacing.  Initial nose was biscuit, butterscotch, and some faint floral hops.  Taste was pine, grapefruit and some yeasty earth.  Mouthfeel was on the watery side of average.  I could have used more carbonation.  Finish was malty with chocolates that yielded to a long lasting bitter hoppy grapefruit follow-through.
