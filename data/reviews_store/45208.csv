The aroma is perplexing.  Youre not too sure whats coming up.  As for the taste, Im not sure how Left Hand was able to liquefy salmon dip but they did.  Was only able to try a small portion so it might have grown on me ",99.206,capistrano,Colorado,8.8%,Left Hand SmokeJumper Imperial Smoked Porter

Full of life this IPA stands out to me because it tastes bright.  The hops are a bit subdued yet fully present.  Nice color and aroma.  Highly recommend this ,91.918,capistrano,Colorado,7.3%,Left Hand Warrior IPA

I really couldnt get over the aroma-smelled like old Bud.  The cloudy look of a pale ale is new to me but I pushed that aside.  The sweet juniper makes a very brief stab at the tongue but overall very malty for a pale and unsatisfying. ,67.937,capistrano,Oregon,5.2%,Rogue Juniper Pale Ale
