The pour is awful, with almost no head. The taste is surprisingly bitter, but not in a good way as if drinking a delicious pale ale. Bottle or tap does not make a difference. Overall all I give this beer a 1 for pretentious advertising out of its class, being overpriced for what it is, and of course for tasting like absolute garbage.

It is only distinguished by the blatant odors of corn and iron emanating from this beer upon opening. The appearance is of a somewhat darker urine, hence the 2 star rating there.
