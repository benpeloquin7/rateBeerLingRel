Lots of roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma, taste is not too sweet, but quite balanced. Finishes a bit bitter and with a touch of alcohol, actually thought that abv was a bit higher. Mouthfeel was very oily and thick with carbonation that smoothened a bit after a while. A very nice beer overall! ",99.894,joohyvni,Colorado,10.5%,Oskar Blues Ten FIDY
