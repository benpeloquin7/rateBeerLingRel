This is, in every facet, the STRONGEST beer Ive ever had. Its ridiculous. No, seriously, ridiculous. Its bitter and sour and sweet and thick and rich and deep and RIDICULOUS. Two inch thick fluffy angel food cake head, syrupy palate, and OPAQUE appearance, as in when I cleaned out the glass after I finished, the small amount of beer left mixed with the tap water to make and iced tea coloured solution that I was almost tempted to taste(I didnt!). Imagine pouring soy sauce into your hand, cause thats IDENTICAL to what this would look like doing likewise. Black licorice is the dominant taste in this stout, with a burnt cream aftertaste. The taste of the stout itself masks the large amount of alcohol in this beer; you really cant taste it at all. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes! Would I buy it again? Probably not. Its amazing, but its not easy to drink. Its like climbing everest; yeah it was fulfilling and rewarding and all that stuff, but you still wouldnt do it twice because it took a lot out of you. Plus, I cant afford it. Bottom line; you need to try it. 20 dollars for this experience is well worth it. ",99.471,joshuabarclay,Oregon,11.6%,Rogue Imperial Stout
