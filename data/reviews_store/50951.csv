Nose of sweet wheat breads, a touch of citrus and herbal notes from the hops. Medium body with light wheat malt flavor, sweet tastes finishes with a slight hoppy dry finish. This was very refreshing.

It is a pale gold, very bright and clear, with a dense creamy white head. The flavor was rich, complex maltiness combined with a pronounced yet soft and rounded bitterness with slight spicy flavor with a bitter finish. The aftertaste was balanced between malt and hops, very clean with no fruity esters. I could tell it was fresh. Nothing worse then a stale/slight old Pilsner, this was not one of them. I have been to Czech several times and every time I drink this beer it takes me back to Prague. ",,bkanderson3,Iowa,5.5%,Turner Alley Czech Village Pilsner

It poured a deep black with rich creamy head.  The aroma had a pronounced chocolate and toffee.  Moderate body with a well balanced chocolate taste very pleasant easy drinking porter.  Its the kind of session beer you could drink all day, very unusual for a porter.  I would highly recommend this beer to everyone.

Not what I was expecting which was a pleasent surprise.  Almost golden pour. Strong creamy blueberry aroma and flavor.  Also had a chance to visit with the head brewer Dean Rouleau.  A great guy to go with the great beers being served.  I would recomend this as well as the Choco-Latte Porter and Hopnotic IPA.  ,34.252,bkanderson3,California,4.5%,San Diego Blueberry Wheat
