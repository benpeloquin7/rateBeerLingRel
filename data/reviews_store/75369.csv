Appearance - Light amber with good clarity and low non-lasting white head.  Moderate carbonation.
Aroma - Fruity.  Almost dominated by the apricots with some floral hop notes as well.  Very much like a Magic Hat #9.
Flavor - Apricots with some floral hops, much like the aroma.  There is a sourness apparent in the middle through the aftertaste which combines with a low bitterness.
Mouthfeel.  Medium bodied with some astringency in the aftertaste and pleasing alcohol warmth.
Overall - Not a favorite.  I would prefer a Magic Hat #9 as this beer feels too one dimensional.  The apricots overwhelm the aroma and flavor and the sourness feels out of place.  My least favorite of the Dogfish Head beers Ive tried. ",90.031,DuckDude,Delaware,7%,Dogfish Head ApriHop

Overall - A different version of the IPA style.  Not as malty or hoppy as most IPAs, seems like more of an American Pale Ale.  Fruity esters, lighter body, and refreshing finish make this a very pleasant session beer. ",57.462,DuckDude,Massachusetts,5.9%,Harpoon IPA
