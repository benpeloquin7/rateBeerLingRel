Most beer retailers do not serve beer at their correct temperatures.  I love this beer when served in its correct temp.  You can easily smell its sweet caramel aroma.  It has a dominant malty sweet taste with a medium bitter finish.  It ha a thin head and light body. ,28.264,Wisan,Philippines,5%,San Miguel Dark Lager
