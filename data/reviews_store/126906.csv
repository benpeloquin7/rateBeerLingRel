Thin body, very pronounced alcohol bite, no normal imperial stout character whatsoever. I inquired at my local beer store how this was selling and was told that this beer was basically being recalled by the distributor as ""bad"". Not sure if the shipment was bad or the entire batch, but Im getting a refund. Ive heard BB lost their head brewer.  I cannot recommend this beer.

This one is different. The classic imperial stout taste is there, but doesnt beat you aside the head with it. Rich taste with good malt and caramel flavors, with a much more subtle hint of the barrel. Some might be put off by this - much more subdued than a Bells Expedition, for instance, but I actually prefer this to the Bells, which was my favorite IS. Another excellent effort by HC!
