I started with this one because I like the idea: Get major beer makers to create their ""desert island beer"" and see what happens. This one fits the bill for me. Theres a lightness to it, and a low 4.5 ABV that would encourage frequent hydration. Its got a nice fluffy head (large bubbles, not creamy) about a pinky thick. Pale cloudy yellow with a steady stream of tiny bubbles rising. I only know the concept ""Simcoe"" hops from the bottle, but I do like the ""California IPA"" style, and this echoes that, to me. Theres a floral funkiness that I love, and a medium bitterness. Looking forward to other ""Table Beer"" entries. ",95.019,JonSmithNYC,New York,4.5%,Evil Twin Table Beer
