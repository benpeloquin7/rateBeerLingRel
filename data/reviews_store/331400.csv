This is BY FAR THE WORST BEER I HAVE EVER CONSUMED. It was skunky, aroma was repulsive, and the after taste was like a kick to the mouth. I am quickly learning that Macro-lights are horrible, but this, this is a step or leap below famous brands such as Bud Light, Blue Light, and even Coors Light. Hell its even worse than Keystone Light.
