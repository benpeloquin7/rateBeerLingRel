But this super fresh Romanian Premium Ciuc Lemon Radler is simply the best ive tasted, in other words then i was love from first zip/taste. The fresh flavour is moderate combi to the sweets, with a very nice duration, syrupy, lime, grape notes. MUST be served and drinked cold, and fits any warm summerday, or in generel actually because its never too sour (like others) 

Im a graphic artist myself, and the branding/colors/fonts is spot on too!

BIG positive recommendations from me
