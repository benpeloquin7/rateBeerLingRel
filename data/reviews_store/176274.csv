Micro bubbles dance their way to the surface, gathering to create a subtle and creamy smooth head that lingers just long enough. With each sip, hints of grapefruit tempt the nose. A sweet, medium malt, with notes of artisan bread always present, not just for the nose, but also for the palate. A gentle tingling effervescence gives texture. No overwhelming shock of bitterness from the hops on the back of the tongue, just a balanced union of roasted barley, hops, and thoughtful brewing. IPA, as nature intended it to be.
