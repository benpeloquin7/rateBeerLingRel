Perhaps with a good tradition that Creemore has, my expactations may have been to high. I coud not shake the unpleasing taste, that reminded me of a plain, light Molson beer. ",43.134,jaymack,Canada,5.3%,Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner

From a bottle, first drink was nothing special, tasted honey more than orange, nothing in aroma and finished more like a crisp lager.
Walked away from the glass for 7 or 8 minutes and tried again. Definitely got the orangey kick on after taste, pleasant not too much.
Nice orangey/light amber colour with great head retension.

May buy again, but it wont be my summer session beer. ",41.497,jaymack,Canada,5.3%,Great Lakes Brewing Orange Peel Ale
