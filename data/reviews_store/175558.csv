Moderate head with large bubbles when poured from the bottle. While advertised, the rasin note is understated at best. Heavy malt flavor eventhough the top note is one of chocolate and caramel. Very crisp finish with a dry lingering finish that leaves you needing another sip.  ",71.45,TimmyEason,Michigan,6%,New Holland Cabin Fever (2007-)
