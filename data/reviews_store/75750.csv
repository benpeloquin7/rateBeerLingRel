Aroma: Typical for a macro.  Smells like crappy adjuncts.

Appearance: Pale yellow, light on fizziness.

Flavor: At best watery with a hint of beer.  At worst I must reassure myself that it did come directly from a sealed can, not out of a garbage can.  Keystone really can be one of the most ""drinkable"" macro-cheapies, but catch it at the wrong temperature/age and its stale flavor can trigger a powerful gag reflex.

Palate:  Can often go down like a gulp of water, but at worst can have a gritty feel that will make your mouth very frightened.

Overall:  Aside from Coors Light this is the best chugging beer on the market bar none.  Play your cards right with the temperature and it has much, much less offensive taste than Natty or Busch.  ""Smooth"" is not all that misleading relative to its competitors. ",,Dartmouthcoop,Colorado,4.2%,Keystone Light
