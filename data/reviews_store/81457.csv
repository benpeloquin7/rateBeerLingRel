Standard hop aroma. Somewhat one dimensional. Overly sweet in my opinion. Taste is good if you can get past the sweetness.  Palate is too heavy. One of these is almost too much unless you have a serious sweet tooth. Go for the Green Flash if you want an Imperial IPA. ,99.788,musher,Delaware,9%,Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA

Pours hazy orange color. 
Aroma is of a nice fruity hoppy nature. Citrus grapefruit notes right off the bat.
Taste is absolutely wonderful bordering on amazing.  In my humble opinion this is the quintessential american IPA. Its not overly sweet by any means. The hop flavor is very fruity in the best possible way. The body is perfect as it is not too thin.  I couldnt think of any way to make this better. Im hoping they will consider an imperial someday.
