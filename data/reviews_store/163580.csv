I felt like this beer couldnt decide what it was trying to be. The beer barely had any flavor and practically no aftertaste. this beer definitely more malty than hoppy. It starts alright after taking a sip but just dies off suddenly. I definitely will stay away from this beer in the future. It was also pretty pricey for what you get. I would recommend you look else where for a beer of this style. ",37.973,beerme212,England,5.2%,Ridgeway Ivanhoe

While I would drink this beer again if offered to me, I wouldnt actively seek it out in stores. I felt it was a little dull on the hoppiness side but it is possible that the bottle I got my hands on sat on the shelves a little too long. I would definitely recommend their West Coast IPA.

Was absolutely fantastic. this is easily one of the top three beers I have ever had. The aroma of this beer is amazing (vanilla, cinnamon, choc, etc.). I was surprised at how smooth this beer goes down for such a heavy stout. I am not a big stout drinker ( more of a hophead) but this beer is definitely worth the hype. Even if you are not a fan of stouts, you should give this brew a try if you ever get the chance because this beer is too good to pass up. ",,beerme212,Florida,11%,Cigar City Hunahpus Imperial Stout
