Pours with very pale yellow, almost no head and no aroma (but then, I do have a bit of a cold).  Didnt have high expectations and was not disappointed, meaning this beer is just plain bad.  Flavor was flat, a little sweet and no hint of any hops at all.  I have another bottle, might try that one to be sure I didnt get a skunky one, but then I doubt that.  Drain pour...
