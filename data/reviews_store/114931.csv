Now I understand why. While I wanted to just sit and enjoy, I found it hard not to gulp it down like a big ol glass of Pepsi on a hot summer day.

Flavorful, however, not too light, yet not too strong.  Somehow you get the feeling this is the affect the creators of this masterpiece were going for.  Ive never seen a beer foam quiet the way this does, when first poured I thought; where are the bubbles, then after it sat for a few seconds, appeared a nice head, not too overwhelming but just the perfect amount.

If I were to craft a brew this would be just what I would hope to have as and end product.
<P>
Now as I sit here a watch The Grinch That Stole Christmas, I also find that it  has that nice affect Gin has, putting that ear-to-ear smile on my face (Im sure its the coffee mixed with the alcohol).

Just remember this isnt the cure for your problems just a cure for life.

or as Homer would say;
""Beer... Now theres a temporary solution.""

This should be on any Stout Lovers top ten list.

Nice color. At $7-$9 a bottle I would porbably pass on another. Very foamy. The wax cannot be wax the crap went everywhere, what a mess, then the cat tried to eat it.. However the wax is a good deterrent not to drink more.The picture on the label looks good. Overall a rather average brew. if it wasnt for the 8% ABV, I would have given it a lower score.
