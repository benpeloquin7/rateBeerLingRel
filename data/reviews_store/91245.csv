The aroma of Frank is pine and a tad bit of citrus. Frank is made with Zeus, Centennial, and Zythos hops. Zeus hops (of CTZ trio fame) are known for being aromatic and pleasant, and Frank certainly possesses those categories in aroma and taste. Centennial hops are another hallmark addition to American-style ales, and Frank benefits from these hops as well. Frank is rounded off by the addition of Zythos hops, which impart some tropical and citrus tones to the taste- but not a lot. More so, Frank smacks of raw hop oil resin and is a little sticky and sweet. The mouthfeel is light to medium and Frank finishes dry.

There is a distinct and recognizable quality about Frank that renders this beer highly drinkable. Frank is a blend of American-style hops but not overpoweringly so. And there is a base malt sweetness, but not ostentatiously so. There is nothing offensive about Frank; a sign of balance and blend success. Frank tastes fresh and delicious.

The aroma of Boomenater is sweet and bready, with some nuttiness and gentle spice notes. Neither of the hop strains used in making Boomenater, Magnum and Perle, produce strong hop bitterness or aroma. The flavor of Boomenater is predominantly sweet malt in the front, with a clean bitterness in the background. A bit of spice does round out the taste, including an earthy, minty feel. Toffee and ""brown ale"" flavors are also noticeable. There are quite a few different malts used in the creation of Boomenater, and their caramel impact occludes any real hop detection. The mouthfeel of Boomenater is syrupy and full.


Overall, Hamburg Brewing Companys Boomenater achieves the traditional bock style: malt domination balanced with subtle spice hops. I would recommend this beer on a thermometer-challenged night in winter or spring. ",,Kevuas,New York,6%,Hamburg Boomenator

The aroma of Hayburner American IPA is predominantly citrus with a backdrop of pine. The taste of Hayburner American IPA is not as citrus up-front as the aroma suggests. Instead, Hayburner American IPA is a nice balance of strong hop bitterness, caramel malt sweetness, and grapefruit and orange. The Warrior hops used to create Hayburner American IPA add a clean hop bitterness, the Falconers flight hops add a Northwest pine touch, and the glacier hops add a gentle fruit aroma. Carapils malt provide just the right amount of sweetness but dont overpower the hops flavors. The mouthfeel of Hayburner American IPA is moderate and the carbonation is right. The alcohol level of Hayburner American IPA is fairly high, but concealed by crisp clean hops.

Overall, Hayburner American IPA is a well-balanced and refreshing American IPA packed with structured flavor. Hayburner American IPA is on the stronger side but very drinkable and balanced. ",78.04,Kevuas,New York,7%,Big Ditch Hayburner American IPA

And I was not wrong!  Ive been wrong in the past, but this time I got lucky :)  Im a big fan of GOOD wheat beers (I cant stand weak ones) so its a love/hate for me where wheats are concerned.  And a pleasant bonus is the ABV in this beer 

The beer pours a nice golden hue with a small head that quickly dissipates.  Minimal lacing and a nice cloudy wheat opaque-ness.

Not many bad things to say about this beer, and its definitely a high-quality wheat.  Above average in terms of taste and drinkability, with no empty aftertaste that some wheats can cause.  I was very satisfied with the mouthfeel and flavor- not too strong not too light.

I would rank this up there with some of my other favorites, Franciscaner and Weihenstephaner. ",91.849,Kevuas,New York,8%,Ithaca Excelsior! White Gold
