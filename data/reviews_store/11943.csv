I'm a big fan of hoppy beers, and IPAs in particular, so this one was a breath of fresh air when my local bar was stocking it.  If you don't like hops, avoid this one.  If you do, seek it out and revel. ",98.082,HubCitySkin,Pennsylvania,6.7%,Victory HopDevil

The smell is rather like sweat and alcohol, in my opinion, and I have to concur with the others about the sweet taste.  Not something you break out to impress people with, but if your goal is a quick, cheap descent into alcohol oblivion, there's very few comparable choices on the beer market.
