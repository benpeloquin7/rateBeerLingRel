A modest soft banana aroma. Golden yellow in color with a shade to the orange side. Wow the taste is overwhelming well balanced of fruits and other complex sugars. Starts sweet and finishes with a subtle sour aftertaste. Overall I was very surprised and this is one of the finest I have had. ,96.078,kevinlpaul,California,8.9%,Stone 20th Anniversary Encore Series: 08.08.08 Vertical Epic Ale
