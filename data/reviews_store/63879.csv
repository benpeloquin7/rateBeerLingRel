The nose has a lot of citrus hop aromas too it with a underlying scent of caramel.  Im struggling to pick up any of the barrel in the nose.

The taste unleashes more hop character at you with some mild roasted and caramel malt flavors.  I start to get some taste of the barrel here and it has a bit of an alcohol bite to it.  It becomes even more so as it warms up.

I will say that I had this on tap at the Funky Buddha recently and was floored by it.  But out of bottle it didnt seem the same.  The bottled brew seemed hoppier than sweet from the malts.  I dont really know what would cause such a difference in a beer that is probably the same age but just in different containers.

Its a Bavarian style pils glass.  It pours a really clear copper color, a lot like a penny.  There is a small white head but it is gone pretty fast.

Big time smoke on the nose.  Nice bacon like aroma in there with some hints of wood, caramel and a very small bit of rye.

Lots of peat smoke and wood in the taste.  There is some malt backing to it that sweetens things up a bit.  This beer, for being as smoky as it is, is incredibly smooth.

So did I enjoy this beer?  You bet I did.  But are there any problems?  Yes there is.  There are not more of it for me to enjoy.  Awesome beer that would make for great drinking this summer while BBQing outside. ",95.019,MikeMoriendi,Wisconsin,8.5%,New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Ale

The nose is grainy, bready and malty.  Some very subtle hop presence.

The taste is really a whole lot of the same.  Crisp and clean finish.

Pretty standard lager. ",69.257,MikeMoriendi,Wisconsin,5%,New Glarus Two Women Lager (2011-)
