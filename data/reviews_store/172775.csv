First you need to hold the bottle over your head and then pour it into a wide glass that has to be almost at your knees. You pour a small quantity and drink it all at once. Do that process and THEN rate it. I think its a extraordinary cider, tipycal Asturian cider, much more sour than the sweet English cider (in my opinion, inferior to the Asturian cider). Again please, Id ask everyone to do the right process before drinking it. If you just pour half the bottle into a glass and drink it it will probably be awful. Id also recommend everyone to visit Asturias in northern Spain to try this kind of (very different) cider and the ""escanciado"" (pouring) process that it involves.
