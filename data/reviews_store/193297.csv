So I will keep it simple.

This is the best $#%*@$## I have ever had!  The flavor is very complex and bold yet smooth. This beer never taste bad or becomes bitter in any way to me.  

Out of all the different beer I have tried in my lifetime, this beer is far ahead of anything else I have tried.

Thank you Mill Street Brewery for such a fantastic product from one of your biggest fans! ",89.183,Dunton,Canada,5.2%,Mill Street Tankhouse Ale
