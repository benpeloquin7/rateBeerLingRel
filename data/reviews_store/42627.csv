Pours a slightly hazy deep brown with a huge off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap as it sticks itself all over my glass. Smells of dark fruits raisins prunes fig come to mind. Also has a sweet dark sugar and molasses aroma as well.   Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is full and sticky sweet, body is thick. I liked this one, but I thought the alcohol was a little to present.
