Appearance is nothing special, but nice, clear, golden, amber. Head is large but doesnt last for too long. Taste is great. I imagine picking up pineapple, cucumber, orange, hops, other juicy stuff, and pine needles. Mouthfeel gives a medium body with an oily texture. Carbonation is fizzy, finish is fairly tangy.
