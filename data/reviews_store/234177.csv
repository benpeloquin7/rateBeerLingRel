Thanks James Birnie! Episode IV (2012). Nose is vanilla, oak, alcohol, liquorice. Black, slight tan head, quickly evaporated, but heavy legs left. Taste is vanilla and oak, slight boozy warmth, doesnt burn, great balance. Palate is silky, slightly oily but not unpleasant. Whoa! So complex! Give this to a wine snob or whiskey brat and theyd be hooked. This is the most wood and vanilla Ive ever had with a beer, after 2 yrs I think the cocoa died a bit but its there in the finish.
