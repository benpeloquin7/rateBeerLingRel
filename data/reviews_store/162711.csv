I know my ratings arent high enough to be counted, but I have been drinking exclusively IPA for the past 3 years and this is the best IPA to date.  The big difference between Sculpin IPA and the others is the aftertaste.  Sculpin IPA leaves a light aftertaste, so much so that I feel like I could still rate food and/or wine if so needed.  Much different than like a ruination IPA, which is so bitter it literally ruins the palette.  When my local beer mart has this, and the wife is ignoring the finances, I will indulge in this beverage any chance I get. ",99.736,jkdhoo,California,7%,Ballast Point Sculpin IPA
