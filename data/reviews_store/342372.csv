Its a different beer and approach to what we are used to here in Belgrade. When I say different, I mean very interesting and rich taste. It has a beautiful smell, the color is very nice and the foam shows quality. The taste is very good. You feel its aromas in the first contact, then some bitterness on the end. I will definitely have it again. ",58.473,Bibilibi,Serbia,4.7%,Ka APA
