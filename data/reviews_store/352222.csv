Great aroma, huge chocolate. Thick tan head as attractive compliment to rich dark color of the beer. Claims to have strong coffee notes but really only tasted that as a bit of bitterness in the lingering after-taste. Checking website not clear whether more is available, but dropped them a note to hope theyd continue this product and supply it retail outside their somewhat remote location.
