I am one of the few who have actually tasted this beer straight from France itself. The stuff that they import to Canada is shit. But the actual local stuff is fantastic. A dark gold colour, with a nice white lasting head. Aroma of citrus, sweet flavor, with a semi-dry finish.  A fantastically crafted beer.

Cloudy, Orange-Red colour, with a lasting off-white head. A nice, soft, whiskey taste on the palate, and then a powerful (yet not overpowering) malt finish.

The only reason I rate this one a 2.3 is because I really like it with a lime. Something about it brings out a nice smooth flavor. However the beer alone is not very good at all. Id probably rate it a 1.5 or so, maybe SLIGHTLY more, but not by much. A yellow pour with an almost non-existent head. A bit of skunky taste but not too much, a little bit of corn and grain as well.
