I gave it a 20/20 since I have not had a better pilsner in the US (All imported beers are pasteurized which makes them loose all their good taste characteristics). Most other reviews disagree but that might be because most people in the US like characteristics of an ale beer. This explains why nearly all ""pilsners"" brewed in the US taste rather like ales. (Note: This pilsner is rather on the bitter side. Maybe its because the brewery used some male hops) ",32.699,Biersommelier,California,5%,JosephsBrau Hopfest
