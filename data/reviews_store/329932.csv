No where near the heavy flavour and IBU count of some other IPAs - this is my current session IPA. Lack of a fruity taste also makes this beer easier to pair with food. The lower price compared with other brews (macro and micro) make this an easy choice if budget is important. ,12.458,Angle,Canada,5.5%,Bowen Island Artisan IPA
